            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And that is the reaſon why ſo many Learned men have lately writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon the uſe and moderation of mens paſſions: And ſpecially <hi>Senault</hi> a moſt Elegant and learned <hi>French</hi> Author: And although his works have lately been tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the Noble Earl of <hi>Monmouth:</hi> yet becauſe they are fitter for Schollers then for the illiterate, I have thought it convenient to publiſh this Treatiſe for the benefit of meaner capacities: In which I have joyned the Scripture-evidences with the principles of Morality. For a good education, with an habit in the precepts of Morality, without the ſanctifying graces of the bleſſed Spirit, are not ſufficient to regulate the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual diſtempers of mens paſſions; becauſe moral precepts and a good education penetrates no further then the bark, and moderates only the diſtempers of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Therefore ſuch as deſire to obtain the maſtery over the intellectual and corporeal diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of their paſſions, are to endevor to attain by fervent prayers from God the graces of the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, as well as an habite in the Principles of Morality: Otherwiſe they will never obtain the maſtery over their paſſions to make them ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the rules preſcribed in the word of God. And whereas <hi>Senault</hi> maintains that men have a Free will to do good or evil, and gives over much power to the Principles of Morality: I ſay we have no Free-will to do good, except it be given us by the Free grace of God, and that the Principles of true Chriſtianity have more power to make men obtain the maſtery over their paſſions then the Principles of Morality can have. Be pleaſed then to accept of theſe Eſſays of mine with the ſame affection as I preſent them unto you: and to account me, as really I am,</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the end be the crown of the work, the creating of man was the crown of the creation; for after God had made man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his own<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 1.27.</note> Image, and had infuſed into him a living ſoul, he reſted<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 2.2.</note> on the ſeventh day from all his works; and this ingrateful man (who was the Maſter-piece of all Gods works, and to whom he had given an unlimited pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative over the beaſt of the field, the fowl of the air, and the fiſhes of the ſea,) did by his diſobedience become inferior to the moſt deſpiſed creatures under the Sun; and by his ſin, all his poſterity that lived under the ſtate of Nature, are more miſerable and fuller of vanity then any of the unreaſonable creatures: for ever ſince
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:122164:6"/>they have been an object of<note n="c" place="margin">Heraclitus.</note> ſorrow to ſome, or a ſubject of<note n="d" place="margin">Democritus.</note> deriſion to others: But becauſe the vanity and miſery of their lives will beſt appear, firſt, by their Conception, ſecondly, by their Infancie, thirdly, by their adoleſcency, fourthly, by their virility, fifthly, by their declination, ſixthly, by their decrepit age. I will will ſpeak of them in order.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, concerning their concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 51.5.</note> (<hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>David, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me,</hi>) it proceeds from a carnall delight, which God hath been pleaſed (for the increaſe and the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of mankinde) to give to the act of generation; for if in lieu of delight this act had been accompanied with dolour, the world had been before this time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of reaſonable creatures, becauſe of the antipathy there is between Nature and Dolour, but between Nature and Delight there is a loving ſimpathy which begetteth a deſire in the Males and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males of conjunction for to increaſe or preſerve their kinde. Now if this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction be not according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, by adhering every man to his wife, and every wife to her
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:122164:6"/>husband; this Delight becoms a Luſt, and by conſequence a ſin, odious to God and men: But ſuppoſe it be by the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed bed of Matrimony, yet their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception according to the Naturaliſts that have dived into the ſecrets of Nature, is ſtrange and homely, for ſix dayes after the conjunction, ſay they, of the husband and the wife, the ſeed of them both, is by the naturall heat of the womb, turned into a kinde of milk, which is incloſed within a skin, much like to the skin of an Egg, and nine dayes after it becomes blood, having within it three ſmall blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the one containing the ſubſtance of the heart; the ſecond containing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the brain, and the third contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſubſtance of the liver, and then after twelve days it becomes fleſh, and then by the admirable work of God the members are formed, and by degrees the veins, ſinews and nerves are ſtrengthened, and within eighteen days more, it pleaſeth God to infuſe into it a living ſoul, and ſo the childe having life, draws his food by his Navel, and by it increaſeth daily in ſtrength, and this food is no other dainties then the menſtruall blood of his mother, held to be the moſt polluted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:122164:7"/>of Nature. now after it hath been impriſoned nine moneths in this obſcure priſon, and fed ſeven months and an half, with this lothſome food, nature growing ſtrong, it breaketh by ſtrugling the skin of the bladder, above ſpoken of, and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the air endeavors to come forth; ſo by his pangs, groans, and ſtruggling, and the violent travel of his mother it is produced to the light, many miſcarrying at their birth by divers accidents, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their mothers womb, ſome by the fright of their mothers, others by ſome rub on her ſides, or by the loathſom ſent of the ſnuff of a candle; beſides their mother is ſubject to ſwoundings, &amp; long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings during her childe-bearing, and their longings and fond deſires are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly for fruits, or for ſtrange and unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory meats, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> being debarred, cauſeth oftentimes the mother and the childe to miſcarry together. The conſideration of theſe things ſhould humble the proudeſt man upon earth, and make him acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg ingenuouſly, that of all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures under the Sun, his conception and birth, are the moſt miſerable.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond, Concerning the Infancie of men, it begins at their birth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:122164:7"/>till they be fifteen years of age; the two firſt years of it is nothing but impotencie, and weak imbecillity to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and charge, trouble, and vexation to his Parents: and whereas other creatures by the benefit of Nature can ſtand upon their legs, and ſeek after their food, man the Lord Paramont of them all is ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in clouts, and not able to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: the yong Chickins as ſoon as they are hatched can run after their Dam, to ſeek for food, and have that ſagacity to hide themſelves under her wings at the fluttering of the Kite: the Lambs, Calves, and yong Colts ſtand ſuddenly upon their legs to ſeek their Dams teats, but man would periſh if his mother by her naturall affection did not bring the nipple of her breaſt to his mouth, and rock him upon her knees: and for the three or four years of this infancy he muſt be carefully tended, for fear he ſhould, like<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> 
                  <hi>Moſes,</hi> put burning coles into his mouth in ſtead of food, or kill himſelf with a knife, or ſome ſharp edged tool: and in the fifth and ſixth year of his age care muſt be taken, that Horſes, Carts, or Coaches, run not over him in the ſtreets: and at ſeven years of his age, he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:122164:8"/>muſt be carefully brought up to learning, according to his birth or degree, either at the Grammar School, or to learn to Write, Cypher, or to keep Accompts, that he may be inabled at fifteen years of age to be ſent to the Univerſity, or placed with merchants or Trades-men, that by a lawfull calling he may live like a man for the time to come. Now for as much as it is the fitteſt time for the education of children, from ſeven years of age to fifteen, Parents muſt be carefull in that time, if they intend to have any comfort of them, to bring them up in the true fear of God, to break them of their Will, and make them attain to an habit of Piety, and morall Vertue: for Education goes beyond Nature, and a yong twig will bend any way, but an old ſtandard will rather break then bow: and therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,<note n="g" place="margin">Prov. 22.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Train up a childe in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it;</hi> and in the 22. <hi>Verſ.</hi> he ſaith,<note n="h" place="margin">Pro. 22.15.</note> 
                  <hi>Folly is naturally bound in the heart of a childe, but the rod of correction will drive it far from him,</hi> and correction to wilfull children is as uſefull to them as their meat and drink; <hi>Withhold not</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Pro. 23.13.</note> 
                  <hi>correction from the childe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon, for if thou beateſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:122164:8"/>him with the rod, he ſhall not die, and thou ſhalt deliver his ſoul from hell.</hi> By theſe Precepts of the Prince of Wiſdom, it is apparent that the onely way to have comfort of our children, is to correct them when they are yong; and the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaſon why this age doth abound more then the former in rebellious children, is the indulgency of the Parents towards them; and this indulgency and fond love of Parents, is the cauſe of two evils: firſt, that the children come to a ſhameful end; ſecondly, that their Parents hoary heads go down <hi>with ſorrow to the grave;</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> confirms the ſame, <hi>The rod and</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Prov. 29.15.17.</note> 
                  <hi>reproof give wiſdom, but a childe left to himſelf bringeth his mother to ſhame:</hi> and in the 17. <hi>verſ. Correct thy ſon and he ſhall give thee reſt, yea, he ſhall give delight unto thy ſoul.</hi> This Infancy of man, is then but meer vanity: for the firſt five years of it, is but imbecillity; the ſecond five but puerility, and the laſt five nothing but malice, obſtinacy and diſobedience; ſo that according to their good or bad edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, they become a bleſſing, or a curſe to their Parents.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the adoleſcency or youth of man, begins at 15 years of age, and ends at
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:122164:9"/>thirty, the greater part of it is ſpent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reſtraint of their Tutors, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and by conſequence freed from cares, and curbed from vices, if their Tutors or Maſters diſcharge their duty; but if they do not, they commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo vicious, that without the ſpeciall grace of God they can never be recalled, and continue prophane and unthrifty all their dayes: And therefore Tutors and Maſters who neglect their duty, and are too indulgent towards their Pupils or Servants, are the cauſe of their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and will be called to a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it before the Tribunal of God; The remiſneſs or indulgency of<note n="i" place="margin">1 Sam. 2.2.3. and 3.17.18.</note> 
                  <hi>Ely</hi> towards his two ſons <hi>Hophny</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> drew a great judgment of God upon him, and upon them both: and the Pupils and Servants that reject the ſharp repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and corrections of their Tutors or Maſters, aggravate their own guilt, and acquit their Tutors and Maſters, for they do not ſhew themſelves onely diſobedient to them, but alſo to God, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth them;<note n="m" place="margin">Ephe. 6.5.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Servants be obedient to them that are your Maſters according to the fleſh, with fear and trembling, in ſingleneſs of your heart, as unto Chriſt, not with eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:122164:9"/>as men pleaſers, but as the ſervants of Chriſt. And ye maſters, do the ſame things unto them, forbearing threatnings; knowing that your maſter alſo is in Heaven, neither is there reſpect of perſons with him.</hi> But when young men are freed from the ſubjection of their Tutors and Maſters, and have as it were, the Bridle caſt over their necks, they run as fiercely after the pleaſures, delights and vanities of the fleſh, as untamed Colts run from their riders, when they have caſt them down; and without Gods ſpecial grace, miſcarry in their race, as it is confirmed by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> who in deriſion of their folly, ſaith, <hi>Rejoyce, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all theſe things, God will bring thee into judgment</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Eccleſ. 11.9.</note> . The reaſon, why in this age men are more addicted to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, then in any other, is, Becauſe their Paſſions are more predominant in them, and experience doth ſhew, That from twenty five yeers, to thirty five yeers of age, men are by the ſtrength of their bodies, the abundance and hear of their blood (in which doth reſide the vital
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:122164:10"/>ſpirits,) fitter for great enterpriſes, where they may ſhew their courage and valor, then at any other ſeaſon, and that the Paſſions of Love, and Ambition, are more violent in them, then in any other age: For the Adoleſcency of men, is compared to the Spring; their Maturity or Virility, to the Summer; their Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to the Autumn or Harveſt; and their decrepit age to Winter, the moſt irkſome time of the yeer. But as it is the moſt pleaſant, and precious age of men, ſo is it the moſt dangerous; for more are carried away with death, in this age, then in any other, becauſe of the diſtemper, and exceſſive riots of young men; which beget burning Feavers, Pleuriſies, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine Apoplexies, and divers loathſom Diſeaſes, that ſends them to their Grave before their time. And as their Paſſions are more turbulent in that age, ſo are their Actions more irregular: Young men being moſt addicted, to Vindication, Spleen, Indignation, Wrath, Rapines, and Oppreſſions, then others; and as fickle, and inconſtant as the wind; fit to undertake, and active to execute; but raſh and inconſiderate, for want of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſolidity of Judgment. In a word,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:122164:10"/>As this age of man hath many rare Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives over the others, ſo it is ſubject to great inconveniencies, and fuller of vanity then any.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The maturity of mans age begins at Thirty, and continues till Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five: In this age mens mindes are commonly full of the cares of this world; they have wives, children, and ſervants to care for; and as their families increaſe, ſo doth their toyl, and their cares: The vices or ſins of their youth, are rather changed then forſaken; their delights and pleaſures, are changed to Envy or Avarice; their deſires are now bent to attain to honor and riches, and to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go their neighbors in all things; but in Vertue, or a Godly life their thoughts flie high, and are bent only upon Machavilian policies, that they may by them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach their Brethren, by falſe lights, by falſifications of Wares, by diſtinctions and equivocations; and as for Religion, they uſe it onely as a baite to deceive men; and are more unſatiable after gain and money, then the Horſe-Leeches are after blood: They account this ſaying of <hi>Solomon</hi> a Paradox. <hi>He that loveth ſilver, ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſilver; nor he that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:122164:11"/>loveth abundance, with increaſe: He that truſteth in his riches ſhall fall, but the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall flouriſh as a branch</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Eccleſ. 10.5, 6, 7, 8.</note> And ſo either by right or wrong, they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rich, and honorable; at leaſt in ſhew, according to the world, but not really according to God; for in his ſight they are the moſt vile, the pooreſt, and the moſt deſpiſed Creatures under the Sun; for they never take into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this ſaying of our bleſſed Saviour. <hi>What availeth, if a man getteth all the world, and looſe his own ſoul?</hi> This virility of man; is then but vanity, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior in Vices to Adoleſcency; but they are not ſo viſible to the eyes of men, but as odious to the eyes of God.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The declination of mens lives begins at fourty five yeers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues till ſeventy. This age of man, is as much ſubject to Envy and Avarice, as the former age is to Ambition, and carking cares; whereby it appears, that mens Paſſions and Sins, do rather change, then forſake them; for volupty, and carnal delights, to which young men are moſt addicted in their Adoleſcency, doth change in their declining age, to Envy and Avarice, and ſometimes their Avarice
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:122164:11"/>doth change to Ambition, a Paſſion more incident to the virility or mature age of men, then to old age; yet divers inſtances may be produced to prove, That Avarice doth change into Ambition, in mens declining age. <hi>Martius Craſsus</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">See <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> in his life.</note> had by a ſordid kinde of Avarice, attained to the greateſt riches of any that we read of; and yet out of Envy that he bore to the warlike atchievements of <hi>Pompeius</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſuch an inſatiable Ambition, or deſire of honor poſſeſſed him in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining age, That at threeſcore and three yeers of age, he gave away half his eſtate to the common people of <hi>Rome,</hi> to obtain a general Commiſſion, to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions that were appointed to make war in the furtheſt parts of <hi>Armenia</hi> againſt the <hi>Parthians.</hi> Which inſatiable and unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Ambition of his, was ingeniouſly reproved by an old <hi>Armenian</hi> Knight (of whom, he did deſire to be informed, of the condition, and diſtance of the way, he was to undergo, and power he was to oppoſe in this <hi>Parthian</hi> journy,) ſaying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, That it was too great for him to undertake the ſame in his declining age, and that the morning Sun of his age, had
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:122164:12"/>been fitter for ſuch an enterpriſe, then the ſetting of it. And had <hi>Craſſus</hi> been ruled by this wholeſom Counſel, he had not by his inſatiable deſire of honor, faln from the higheſt degree of worldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity to the loweſt degree of humane diſgrace and miſery, as he did; for by this raſh enterpriſe, he was the cauſe of his own death, and of his eldeſt ſons, and of the lives of a great part of the braveſt Nobility of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the rout and utter overthrow of his whole Army. This is to prove, That men in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining age, are fitter for Counſel, then for Action; and that is the reaſon, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, the Counſel of <hi>Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,</hi> and the Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> have been, and are compoſed of men, much advanced in their declining age; becauſe their Paſſions are commonly more moderate, their Experience greater, their Judgment more ſolid, and their Counſels ſafer, then of thoſe who are in the youth or virility of their age; for as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>With the ancient ſhould be wiſdom; and in length of yeers, underſtanding</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Job 12.12.</note> Contrarily, there have been others, in whom the deſire of honor hath raigned in their youth and virility, as their Noble Martial atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:122164:12"/>do witneſs, who have changed this Ambitious Paſſion into the Sordid Paſſion of Avarice, in their declining age. As may appear by the lives of <hi>Veſpaſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">See <hi>Dion,</hi> and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and the French Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories.</note> of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth King of <hi>France.</hi> Howſoever, the deſire of Wine, of Money, and the malicious Paſſion of Envy is more natural, and doth common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſe with age, as much as raſh Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity, and carnal Delights do diminiſh by age; whereby I conclude, That the declining age of men is not free from Vanity. For what greater Vanity can there be, then to Envy at another mans proſperity? or to deſire Wine, when our head-piece is ſo weakened by age, that it cannot overcome the vapors of it? or to deſire Money, when we have leſs need of it, ſith we daily expect to be carried to our Graves?</p>
               <p>Sixthly and Laſtly, The decrepit age of men begins at ſeventy, and ends when Death ſtrikes them with her Dart; which is according to the courſe of life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween fourſcore, or fourſcore and ten: For none attains to the days of <hi>Methuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi>
                  <note n="ſ" place="margin">Gen. 6.26</note> , or of the Patriarks, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> for God hath ſhortened the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:122164:13"/>days of men, becauſe of their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as it appears, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.3. <hi>My Spirit,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man, for he alſo is fleſh, yet his dayes ſhall be an hundred and twenty years:</hi> and the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man that hath been known in this age of the world, was a <hi>Shropſhire</hi> Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was brought up to <hi>London</hi> as a wonder, in the days of King <hi>James,</hi> who was ſaid to be one hundred and thirtie three years of age; and this long life of his, according to the opinion of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Phyſitians, did proceed from the ſimplicity of his meate and drink, for as ſoon as he came to be fed with the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Court, he came to be diſeaſed, and ſuddenly departed this life. <hi>Plinius,</hi> and other Naturaliſts, have much troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themſelves to finde out the naturall reaſons why mens lives are ſo ſhort: the beſt reaſon they give for it, is, their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate diet, and the variety of dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and change of ſuperfluous meats, cooked with art, inticing men to glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and drunkenneſs; for daily experience doth ſhew, that thoſe who live ſoberly, and live upon ſimple food, avoiding ſlowth and idleneſs, do live commonly longer then ſuch as feed on dainties, and

                  <hi>That the wages of ſin is death:</hi> howſoever the decrepit age of men, except it be indowed with free grace, and ſanctified by the bleſſed Spirit of God, it is the <hi>vanity of vanities,</hi> and the miſery of all miſeries; for the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous infirmities incident to it, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if penury doth accompany the ſame, for old age with penury is the greateſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction that can befal to generous ſpirits, and the greateſt tentation of Satan to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice men to deſpair; for if rich men, who have all manner of comforts, cannot with patience ſupport the infirmities of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit age, but murmure, as ſome have done in my hearing, that they were weary of their lives; of what diſtemper muſt the poor aged people be, who have no worldly comforts at all, but are ready to ſtarve for cold, and to famiſh for want of food! therefore tender and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionated Chriſtians ſhould exerciſe their charity upon theſe objects of unparalleld miſery, as the moſt acceptable ſacrifice they can offer to God: and yet all the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:122164:14"/>hearts of moſt men are ſo hardened by a juſt Judgment of God upon this Nation for its tranſgreſſions, that they can look upon theſe dying objects of compaſſion, whoperiſh daily in the ſtreets without pity or reluctation. Now for a concluſion and confirmation of the vanity and miſery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the life of men: I will make a ſhort relation of the Maladies incident to every one of the ages of their lives: firſt, in their very conception they may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, by ill ſents and vapours, and by divers accidents of bruiſes or falls: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in their infancy, by the ſquincy, convulſions, meaſles, or the ſmal pox: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in their adoleſcency, by the ſword, the pleureſie, and burning feavers: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in their virility by ſanguin apoplexies, bloudy-flixes and conſumptions: fifthly, in their declining age, by the ſtone and the gout, by dropſies, paralepſies, and flegm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick apoplexies: and in the decrepit age, by gouts, aches, cough, the retentions of urine, the ſtrangullion, poverty, cold, and hunger, and divers other caſualities; ſo that I may boldly conclude with <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> that the lives of naturall and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men and women, <hi>are meer vanity and vexation of ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the vanity of worldly honors.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS the end of the Creation of man was the glory of his Creator; even ſo the end of the lives of men ſhould be the increaſe of the glory of their Maker: but the lives of the greater part of them have no other end then the honors, riches, and pleaſures of this world; and therefore to ſhew you more perfectly the vanity of mens lives, of which I have made a ſhort Narration in the former Chapter: I conceive it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to deſcribe unto you in theſe three Chapters following the vanity of their deſires, before I come to ſpeak of their Paſſions, for the deſires of honors, riches, and pleaſures are the three deities they adore, and to whom they ſacrifice mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and evening their beſt thoughts, and theſe for their unparallel'd vanity, may be called the <hi>vanity of vanities.</hi> I will then begin with the deſires of worldly honors, which are either ſpiritual or temporal, the ſpiritual are free from vanity, becauſe they are ſupernatural, and full of true joy
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:122164:15"/>and comfort: but the temporal honors are but a meer conceit and ſhadow, a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour without ſubſtance and ſubſiſtance; and yet the moſt powerful charm of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, whereby he lulls men aſleep in the Paradiſe of fools, to caſt them when they are awake into the bottomleſs pit of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal woe; for had not Satan held them to be the ſtrongeſt of his temptations, he had not reſerved them for his laſt batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt the conſtancy of our bleſſed Saviour, as it appears in the fourth of <hi>Matthew, verſ.</hi> 8, 9.<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 4 8.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high monntain, and ſheweth him all the Kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, and ſaid unto him, All theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me:</hi> Yet although this roaring Cannon of his could not prevail againſt this invincible Rock, it doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with many thouſands in theſe dayes, whom he deludes by the glorious gliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of worldly honors, and doth falſely ſuggeſt in their mindes that they are the ſupream good, in which doth conſiſt their bliſs and felicity, and makes them venter their bodies and ſouls to injoy and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them. But to inlighten the eyes of theſe Monopoliſts of honors: I will here
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:122164:15"/>ſet out the vanities of worldly honors in their lively colours, that they may avoid this dangerous ſnare of Satan, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to indeavor to attain unto the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual honors that will fill their ſouls with unſpeakable joys and comforts. And to this end I will ſhew in the firſt place the vanity of the means whereby men uſually attain to worldly honors, which for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſake I will reduce to theſe: firſt, by Deſcent; ſecondly, by Strength; thirdly, by Beauty; fourthly, by Riches; fifthly, by Favors; ſixthly, by Learning; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, by Prudence; eightly, by Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Secondly, I will ſhew to whom ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is truly due; and Laſtly, I will give a hint of the excellency, and of the joy and comfort that men may injoy from ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall honors.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, Such as are nobly deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">Deſcent of race is the firſt means to attain to worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.</note> are honorable by their birth, ſo they degenerate not from the vertues and valour of their Anceſtors, for if they do, they are baſer then the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> becauſe they have a great advantage over them to attain to the true perſonal honor; <hi>for</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">See <hi>Charon</hi> in his <hi>Wiſdom Cap.</hi> 59.</note> 
                  <hi>Nature doth always endeavor to return to its firſt principle;</hi> and that is the reaſon why the reply that <hi>Marius</hi> made to a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:122164:16"/>
                  <hi>Patrician,</hi> who out-braved him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his <hi>Plebeian</hi> deſcent, is ſomuch commended: My<note n="c" place="margin">See <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> life.</note> nobility, ſaith he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with me, and thine ends with thee; and it is certainly more honorable to be the ſpring of a noble race, then the end of it: therefore perſonal nobility is reputed to be more noble then that of deſcent, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the perſons thus deſcended do equal or excel their Anceſtors in vertue and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and when it is ſo, they are to have the precedency before a new ſtarted Moucheron, that is the firſt of his race, that hath obtained by his perſonal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and valour the honor to be a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But what cauſe have men to boaſt, or vant, or conceive themſelves honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble becauſe of their deſcent, except they be vertuous and valourous themſelves? for it is a ridiculous vanity to vant of the gifts that were never our own, and did belong to other men: and yet it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vanity, much in faſhion in theſe days among our Gentlemen, to vant of their Anceſtors vertues and valour, when themſelves are effeminate and vicious in their maners, lives and converſations: Beſides, what have men worthy to vant and boaſt of? <hi>for they were formed out of the

               <p>For the third, which is an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:122164:17"/>ſtature, comlineſs and Beauty: divers have attained to honor by theſe gifts of Nature:<note n="l" place="margin">Sam. 10.23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Saul</hi> for his extraordinary ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and perſonal parts was choſen King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as it appears in the tenth of the firſt of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 23, 24. <hi>verſes, And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he ſtood among the people, he was higher then any of the people from the ſhoulders upwards; and Samuel ſaid to all the people, See ye him whom the Lord hath choſen? that there is none like him among the people, And all the people ſhouted, and ſaid, God ſave the King:</hi> but for as much as the perſonal repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the body without the gifts of the minde, is not ſufficient for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the honorable function of a King: it is ſaid in the 9. <hi>verſe,</hi> that God was pleaſed to adorn him, after he was choſen, with the ſpirit of Government, <hi>viz.</hi> with <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ornament of a Prince: <hi>And it was ſo that when</hi> Saul <hi>had</hi>

                  <hi>turned his back to go from</hi> Samuel, <hi>God gave him another heart.</hi> Contrarily it might be proved by divers inſtances, that the deformity of body, a ſmall ſtature, and the want of perſonal repreſentation is a great impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to Princes, becauſe the common
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:122164:18"/>people do always more regard the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gifts, then the intellectual, as it doth appear in the lives of<note n="n" place="margin">See <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> and <hi>Quintius</hi> in their lives.</note> 
                  <hi>Agiſclaus,</hi> of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidas, Philopoemen,</hi> all wiſe and valourous Princes and Commanders that were deſpiſed of the vulgar ſort, becauſe they were of a ſhort ſtature, and of no repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative Majeſtie: but the comlineſs of <hi>Alexander, Alcibiades,</hi> and of <hi>Pompeius</hi> the great, made them to be honored and reſpected above others:<note n="o" place="margin">2 Sam. 14.25.</note> 
                  <hi>Abſolom</hi> was alſo much beloved of his father, and honored of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for his comlineſs and natural indowments, <hi>for from the ſoal of his feet to the grown of his head, there was no blemiſh in him:</hi> And the comely fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and excellent beauty of <note n="p" place="margin">Eſther 1.1. and 2.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Eſther</hi> made her from a Captive attain to that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative honor, to be the Queen of the great King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> who raigned from <hi>India,</hi> even to <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> over one hundred and twenty ſeven Provinces; <hi>and the King loved</hi> Eſther <hi>above all the women, and ſhe obtained grace and favour in his ſight more then all the Virgins, ſo that he ſet the royall Crown upon her head, and made her Queen in ſtead of</hi> Veſta. It is then apparent that perſonal repreſentation, comlineſs, and beauty, are means whereby men and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:122164:18"/>women, attain to worldly honors: but how ſandy the foundation of theſe honors is, I leave it to the conſideration of the Reader, for nothing is more caſuall and ſubject to mutation then comlineſs and beauty, and therefore theſe honors are meer vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">The fourth means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain honors is by riches.</note> Riches are an ordinary means in this vicious age, whereby men attain to worldly honors; for honors that are the onely recompence of wiſdom, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, fidelity and valour, are now ſold for ready money; and the honorable titles of Earls, Barons, Knights, Eſquires and Gentlemen are obtained for a lump of clay, gold or ſilver, the baſe excrements of the earth: this is one of the ſecondary cauſes of all our diſtractions and preſent miſeries, and hath ever been the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Kingdoms, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales: as long as the <hi>Roman</hi> civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Senators, and Commanders of Armies were choſen in to ſuch places of honor and truſt for their noble<note n="q" place="margin">See <hi>Livius</hi> Decades.</note> deſcent, their prudence and valour, their State did flouriſh, and did inlarge its domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more in one century of years, then it did in three after theſe places of honor became to be venal, and purchaſed by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:122164:19"/>conceſſion, for then men of no parts were for money promoted to higheſt dignities, whereupon civill contentions were fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, factions increaſed, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bloudy<note n="r" place="margin">See <hi>Appian</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> civil wars.</note> inteſtine wars maintained, by which the ancient liberties of that State were ſuppreſſed, and the laſt, government of it changed into an Imperiall Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. As long as the chiefeſt Officers of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and the places of Judicature of the Realm were given by <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, ſurnamed the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> to men of learning, of wiſdom, and valour; in recompence of their loyalty, vertue, and merits, that Kingdom did flouriſh with peace, honor, and proſperity, and the Courts of<note n="ſ" place="margin">See the Hiſtory of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> Parliaments of <hi>France</hi> had the honor for their Juſtice and Equity, to be the Arbitrators and Umpires of all the differences that hapned in thoſe days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the greateſt Princes of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: but when theſe places of honor and truſt were made venal, in the reigns of <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Charls</hi> the ninth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and ſold for ready money to ſuch as gave moſt for them; then was Juſtice and Equity baniſhed, and that flouriſhing Kingdom reduced to the brim of ruine and deſolation, by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:122164:19"/>of factions, and a bloody civill war: And the ſelling of places of honor, and Judicature of late years in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, hath been the ſpring of all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, diviſions, and diſtractions, which have ſomented this unnatural war, becauſe of the injuſtice, rapines, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that followed at the heels the ſale of theſe places of honor and truſt, for ſuch as bought them by the great, ſold them to their Clients by retail; whereby it appears, that honors bought for money are deſtructive to the Sellers, to the State, and to the Buyers; and that ſuch as injoy them, carry upon their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads rather ignomy then honor.</p>
               <p>For the fifth, Concerning favors, many have been promoted to worldly honors,<note place="margin">The fifth means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, is by the favor of Princes.</note> by favor of the Prince, or ſuch as are in authority for their vertue and merits; but of theſe commendable favors I intend not to ſpeak of, as being out of faſhion in theſe days, but undeſerving favors, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from vicious ſervices:<note n="t" place="margin">Eſther 3.5.</note>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:122164:20"/>not by vertue or merit, ſo the end of them was but ſhame and confuſion. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Nero</hi> promoted <hi>Tygelenus</hi> by favor to the greateſt dignities of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, but it was becauſe he had been the private agent to his baſe and laſcivious delights, for which he was juſtly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his honors, and of his life by the Emperor<note n="r" place="margin">See <hi>Tacitus</hi> in <hi>Othos</hi> life.</note> 
                  <hi>Otho.</hi> And how many are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted in theſe days to great honors for the like ſervices, or for being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors of new impoſts and taxes, for fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in troubled waters, for betraying their truſt, for ſelling the liberties of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, for changing their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as the Camelions do their colours at every new object? Theſe I ſay, are the noble ſervices for which men are in theſe days promoted to places of honor and profit; but alas! the honors and riches purchaſed by ſuch means, will be like the brand of <hi>Cain</hi> upon their forehead, and like a Moth in a piece of cloth, and like the gnawing Worm of a deſpairing Conſcience that will for ever rack them, and force them to cry out, <hi>Vanity of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, all is vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</hi>

               <p>For the ſecond branch of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, concerning the perſons that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be honoured, I will be very brief, becauſe all rational men are acquainted with this duty: firſt, in the firſt of S <hi>Peter, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. there is a general charge, <hi>Honor all men, love the brotherhood, fear God, and honor the King:</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> in his<note n="l" place="margin">Prov. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Proverbs</hi> goes further; for we are not onely to fear God, but we are alſo to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor him; <hi>Honor the Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>with thy ſubſtance, and with the firſt fruits of all thine increaſe;</hi> and next to God and the King, we are to honor our Parents;<note n="m" place="margin">Exod. 20 12.</note>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:122164:25"/>them the grave and ancient men;<note n="n" place="margin">Levit. 19.32.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt riſe up before the hoary head, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor the face of the antient;</hi> and yet who are more deſpiſed then old men in this corrupt Age? for young men are now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to places of Dignity, Profit, and Truſt, contrary to former Ages; for <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> by theſe words, <hi>As ſnow in Summer, and rain in Harveſt, ſo is honor not ſeemly for a fool;</hi> intimates, that young men are not to be honored with places of Truſt in Church or Commonweal, becauſe they are for want of experience no better then fools, and yet they account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves generally out of a vain preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wiſer then old men, whom they call doting fools: for want of the knowledge of this Proverb, <hi>Before Honor is Humility;</hi> for were they truly wiſe, they would be humble, and not preſumptuous; for preſumption is the companion of Folly; beſides vertuous, learned, wiſe, prudent and valiant men are to be honored. I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh Learning from Prudence and Wiſdom, becauſe learned men are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wiſe nor prudent, although Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is a means to attain to Wiſdom; but Learning is the theorical part of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and without a long practical expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:122164:25"/>a Learned man cannot attain to Prudence or Wiſdom. As for rich men, which are above all others honored in theſe days, except they be Magiſtrates, or publike Officers, or have any of theſe qualities above ſpoken of; I ſee no reaſon why they ſhould be honoured above the common civility for their Riches; yet an ancient Greek Philoſopher, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded which of the two, the Rich or the Wiſe ſhould be moſt honored, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, The wiſe; yet, ſaith he, I ſee both the learned and the wiſe court and attend upon the rich: but above all other the true ſanctified children of God ſhould be honoured, becauſe they are the onely<note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 16.3.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent upon earth.</p>
               <p>For the laſt Branch of this Diſcourſe, which is the joy and comfort that men reap from ſpiritual honors: 1. They that will attain to ſpiritual honor, muſt above all things honor God; for if they honor any above him, they ſhall be lightly eſteemed; this is confirmed in the firſt of <hi>Samuel,</hi> Chap. 2. verſ. 30. When the Lord by one of his Prophets reproved <hi>Eli</hi> for honoring of his ſons above him; <hi>I ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that thy houſe, and the houſe of thy</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THere are two ſorts of riches; the one worldly, and the other ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; the ſpiritual are the immediate gifts of God, and by conſequence ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent: but the worldly are meer <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and vexation of ſpirit,</hi> ſubject to divers accidents and changes; <hi>Wilt thou,</hi> ſaith <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>

                  <hi>ſet thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches make themſelves wings; they flye away as an Eagle toward heaven;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding men make an Idol of riches, and will venter their lives, and hazard their ſouls to obtain and enjoy them. Now as comparing two objects together,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:122164:27"/>it is eaſie to diſcern which is the moſt excellent of the two: ſo by the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the imperfections of the worldly riches, againſt the perfections of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, the excellency of the laſt will be more viſible to the Reader. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore begin with the worldly; and for method ſake obſerve theſe four Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: firſt, how they are obtained: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, how they are perſerved: thirdly, how they are loſt: fourthly, how they are to be diſpenſed.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, Worldly riches are of an indifferent nature, and by conſequence, become good or evil by accident: I mean, that they are either a bleſſing or a curſe, by the evil or good acquiſition and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of them. They are called the gifts of fortune, becauſe they are more proper to the undeſerving then to the well-deſerving men; for fortune being blinde, doth commonly diſtribute her gifts more by chance, then by judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And daily experience doth ſhew, that the wicked abound in worldly riches, and the righteous are poor and needy. <hi>Wherefore do the wicked live, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come old, yea, are mighty in power?</hi> ſaith Job. <hi>Their ſeed is eſtabliſhed in their

                  <hi>and their off-pring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes: Their houſes are ſafe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. Their bull gendreth and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, their Cow calveth and caſteth not her Calf. They ſend forth their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones like a flock, and their children dance. They take the Timbrel and Harp, and rejoyce at the ſound of the Organ: And ſpend their dayes in wealth.</hi> The reaſons why ungodly men do out-ſtrip the godly in Riches, may be theſe:

                     <item>1. Becauſe they have a larger conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence then the godly.</item>

                     <item>3. Becauſe they erroneouſly conceive that they were created for no other end then for to enrich themſelves, whereas the godly make conſcience of enriching themſelves by any indirect means, hold the love and favour of God their ſupream good: and are confident that they were only created to propagate the honour and glory of their Creator. The main end of the ungodly being then to enrich themſelves: it is no wonder if they out-ſtrip the godly in wordly

               <p>For the firſt, The riches of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> did immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the hand and bleſſing of God; for their innocent vocation did depend only upon the bleſſing of God,<note place="margin">Gen. 26.12.</note> and not upon the art and induſtry of man: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God was pleaſed that the earth ſhould bring forth a hundred for one,<note place="margin">Gen. 30.43.</note> and that their Cattel ſhould multiply extraordinarily.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Men become rich by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:122164:28"/>ſucceſſion, as <hi>Solomon</hi> by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Treaſures that his Father King <hi>David</hi> heaped up together by the Wars he had with divers Nations, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Sir <hi>Walter Raughleys</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion cannot be paralleld in any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Men grow to be rich by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diligent and active in their lawful calling; for as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Prov. 10.4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>He becometh poor that dealeth with a ſlack hand, but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>He that gathereth in Summer is a ſon of wiſdom, but he that ſleepeth in harveſt is a ſon of ſhame.</hi> Now theſe three wayes of obtaining worldly riches, are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and approved of God, ſo the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of them be ſutable to his word.</p>
               <p>But the fourth, That is by indirect and unlawful means, it is odious to God, and deſtructive to men; And yet it is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way whereby men do attain to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible riches: And ſpecially by theſe four ſorts of Profeſſions. 1. By the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Arms. 2. By the managing of Politick affairs. 3. By the practice at law. 4. By the practice of Merchandiſe, which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:122164:29"/>ſhall be proved by inſtances. Firſt, by the practiſe of Arms; <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Lucullus</hi> became incredibly rich,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in their lives.</note> but it was by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt rapines and Tyrannical couſes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Sejanus</hi> and <hi>Titus Vinius,</hi> by the managing of Politike affairs became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily wealthy,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Tacitus.</note> but it was by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion and bribery. Thirdly, by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe at Law, Sir <hi>John Cook</hi> and Judge <hi>Richardſon</hi> became wealthy and rich, but it was by condemning the innocent, and acquitting the guilty. Fourthly, by the practiſe of Merchandize, <hi>Peter de Medecis,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Spencer</hi> became extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich, but it was by falſifying and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolizing of all manner of Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Whereupon I conclude with <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, That ſuch as make haſte to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For the ſecond, firſt, the preſervation of riches is as irkſom to the minde as their acquiſition hath been painful to the body; for when men have heaped up much wealth, they are in continual fears to be deprived of them, and hold no place ſecure for the keeping of their treaſures. Secondly, Riches expoſe their owners to eminent dangers to preſerve
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:122164:29"/>them, for as the higheſt Cedars in a tempeſt, are more ſhaken then the low ſhrubs, even ſo rich men in a Civil war are the objects of the falſe accuſations of all Promoting Knaves; as it appears in<note n="k" place="margin">You may finde divers inſtances to prove this point in <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Tacitus;</hi> and in the life of <hi>Sylla</hi> there is a notable inſtance for it, for although a <hi>Roman</hi> Senator, called <hi>Quintus Aurelius,</hi> (in the civil wars between <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi>) had always kept himſelf neuter, and never ſided in words and actions, with either of theſe two parties, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>Sylla</hi> coming victorious to <hi>Rome,</hi> his name was written in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of ſuch as had been of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors of the faction of<note n="l" place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Marius,</hi> and for no other reaſon, but becauſe he was very rich, and had a ſtately Palace at <hi>Alba,</hi> and ſo loſt his life becauſe of his riches. But it were in vain to prove this Point by many forraign inſtances, ſith in this unnatural civil war of ours: many have been accounted Round-heads, and other Malignants, that neither had ſided with one or the other ſide, but meerly becauſe of their riches. Thirdly, Rich men are commonly the prey of Theeves; for where ſtore of gold and ſilver is, theſe ſpirits never leave haunting, <hi>For
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:122164:30"/>whereſoever the</hi>

                  <hi>carcaſs is, there will the Eagles be gathered together.</hi> In Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days a Pirate of <hi>Dunkerk</hi> laid a plot with twelve of his mates to carry away Sir <hi>Iohn Spencer,</hi> which if he had done, fifty thouſand pounds ranſome had not redeemed him: he came over the ſeas in a Shallop with twelve Musketiers, and in the night came into <hi>Barking-Creek,</hi> and left the Shallop in the cuſtody of ſix of his men, and with the other ſix came as far as <hi>Iſlington,</hi> and there hid themſelves in ditches, near the path in which Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> came always to his houſe:<note n="n" place="margin">I have this out of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Record.</note> but by the providence of God, Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> upon ſome extraordinary occaſion was forced to ſtay in <hi>London</hi> that night, otherwiſe they had taken him away; and they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſhould be diſcovered; in the night time came to their Shallop, and ſo came ſafe to <hi>Dunkerk</hi> again. This was a very deſperate attempt; but hear another of the like nature, only it was more bloody, and more ſucceſsful, for the villains that undertook the ſame, ſome two years paſt it hapned at <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> that ten ſtout theeves had notice given them that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had received ſix thouſand pounds in gold, and had cauſed them to be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:122164:30"/>laid in a chamber, next to his own bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber in the Palace of<note n="o" place="margin">This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Paris,</hi> in the year 1647. at the beginning of the year.</note> 
                  <hi>Lugſeinbourg</hi> his ordinary abode; hereupon they plotted to ſteal away this gold, &amp; ſo in the day time got into the great garden, and in the night broke into the middle court, and with a ladder of cords got up to the Chamber window, &amp; ſo into the chamber, ſlew two Gentlemen that were aſleep in their bed, and carried away the gold, unheard, and undiſcovered, although there was above one hundred Officers and ſervants in the houſe, and that the Duke lay in the next Chamber. Many other inſtances might be produced for the confirmation of this Point, That riches do expoſe their owners to great dangers, but theſe ſhall ſerve for brevity ſake. Fourthly, the care of the preſervation of riches interrupts the reſt and ſleep of men, and hinders learned men from their Studies, and others from their ordinary employments. It is recorded, that the Tyrant <hi>Policrates,</hi> to ſhew his liberality, gave at one time to the Philoſopher <hi>Anacreon</hi> three talents, that is above nine hundred pounds <hi>ſterlin,</hi> but after he had it ſome four or five days in his cuſtody, the care he took to preſerve the ſame, did ſo trouble his minde, that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:122164:31"/>he neither could take his reſt in the night, nor in the day tend his School as he did before, for the fear he had that theeves ſhould break into his Chamber in the night, and deprive him of his gold, took away his ſleep, and the carking cares he took in the day to diſpoſe of his money to increaſe the ſame, hindred him from his Studies; whereupon being vexed in his minde, he carried the ſaid money again to the Tyrant, intreating him to keep it himſelf, for it had done him more hurt in that time, then it could ever do him good if he kept the ſame. And <hi>Demetrius</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">See <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> in the tranquillity of the mind.</note> the <hi>Phalerian,</hi> who by trading in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize had attained to be very rich, finding his minde daily more and more perplexed with the increaſe of his wealth, went to hear the Philoſopher <hi>Crates,</hi> who made publique Lectures upon the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of the minde, and having learned that riches were the greateſt diſturbers of the ſame, gave away all his riches to his poor kinſmen, that he might with moore freedom apply himſelf to the Studies of Philoſophy: Even ſo, if the rich men of theſe days would divide their riches into three parts, and give the firſt part to the poor, and the ſecond to their
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:122164:31"/>poor kinſmen, and keep the third part for themſelves, they would be more free to frequent the hearing of the Word of God, and more careful to make their calling and election ſure: for the cares of their great riches do ſo diſquiet their minds, that they have no time to indeavor to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come<note n="q" place="margin">An Alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the 17. ver. of the 3.

                  <hi>rich in God, and ſo in the midſt of their riches remain wretched, miſerable, poor, blinde, and naked in the ſight of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the third, Riches are loſt divers ways, for there is nothing more ſubject to accidents then riches: ſome looſe their riches by theeves, as it hath been ſhewed, other looſe them inſenſibly, others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them by riots, gaming, and whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, others by prodigalities, others by gluttony and drunkenneſs, others by building ſtately houſes, others by caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of fire, others by imbraſing more then they can gripe, I mean by undertaking of things beyond their abilities, others by their inconſtancy, by changing their dwelling, and their profeſſion, for this Proverb is not more common then true, <hi>That a rowling ſtone never getteth Moſs,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by ſloath and idleneſs, <hi>For he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh poor,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon,</hi>

                  <hi>that dealeth with a ſlack hand:</hi> But rich men do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:122164:32"/>loſe their riches by theſe four means: firſt, by ventring over their abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at ſea, by ſhipwrack, and Pirats: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by invaſion of a forraign enemy: thirdly, by ſiding in a civil war with an unfortunate party: fourthly, by tyranny and oppeſſion; and for confirmation of it I will give ſome inſtances. The Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher <hi>Zeno</hi> had been in his former time a rich Merchant, but having loſt his wealth by a Shipwrack, gave himſelf to the Study of Philoſophy: and I could here produce the names of divers <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants that have loſt all their means by Pirats &amp; ſhipwracks, if I did not regard their fame: ſecondly, by forraign Invaſions; <hi>Creſus</hi> loſt his incredible trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures by the invaſion of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> the laſt King of <hi>Perſia</hi> his unparallel'd riches by the invaſion of<note n="ſ" place="margin">See <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> in his Life.</note>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:122164:32"/>war of both parties? Fourthly, by tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and oppreſſion rich men commonly loſe their riches, for Tyrants are always jealous of rich men, becauſe moneys are the ſinews of war; ſo where Tyranny raigns the rich men go to rack; <hi>Piſo</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">See <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in their Lives.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Emperor <hi>Otho</hi> loſt his life for his riches, and ſo did <hi>Seneca</hi>

In a word, it is dangerous to be rich, a moderate eſtate is ſafer, and there is no confidence to be repoſed in riches; for as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,<note n="y" place="margin">Pro. 11.28.</note> 
                  <hi>He that truſteth in his riches ſhall fall, but the righteous ſhall flouriſh as a branch;</hi> nor profit nothing at the hour of death, for as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,<note n="z" place="margin">Pro. 11.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Riches profit not in the day of wrath, but righteouſneſs delivereth from death:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, men preſume upon their riches, for as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith in another place, <hi>The rich man is wiſe in his own conceit; but the</hi>

                  <hi>Like ſheep they are laid in the grave, death ſhall feed on them, and the upright ſhall have dominion over them in the morning, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:122164:33"/>their beauty ſhall conſume in the grave from their dwelling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the fourth, of the diſpenſation of riches; in this conſiſts the bliſs, or woe of rich men; for it is certain that they are but the Stewards of their riches, and that the Lord will call them to an account how they have diſpenſed of them; for Stewards, ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 4.2.</note> are to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: now if the rich man ſpoken of in the Goſpel, might call his Steward to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and ſay thus unto him;<note n="d" place="margin">Luke 16.2.</note> 
                  <hi>How is this that I hear this of you? give an account of your Stewardſhip: for you may not be any longer ſteward,</hi> how much more may the Lord of Lords call rich men to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the wealth that he hath been pleaſed to intruſt them withall? for by him onely <hi>they live and move,</hi> and all they have are the free gifts of his liberality: And in the twefth <hi>Chapter</hi> of the ſame <hi>Goſpel</hi> the Character of a good and bad Steward is elegantly ſet forth, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the good, and the puniſhment of the bad Steward is exactly ſet down in theſe words,<note n="e" place="margin">Luke 12.42, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 47.</note> 
                  <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Who then is that faithful and wiſe ſteward, whom the Lord ſhall make ruler over his houſhold, to give their portion of meat in due ſeaſon?
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:122164:33"/>Bleſſed is that ſervant whom the Lord when he cometh ſhall finde ſo doing: Of a truth I ſay unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath. But if that ſervant ſay in his heart, my Lord delayeth his coming, and ſhall begin to beat the men-ſervants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and be drunken; the Lord of that ſervant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in ſunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers: And that ſervant which knew his Lords will, and prepareth not himſelf, neither did according to his Will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> By this it appears that upon the good or evil diſpenſation of riches, depends the bliſs and woe of rich men; and yet there is not one of a hundred that diſpenſe of them as they ſhould, or may truly be called wiſe and faithful ſtewards, for the greater part conſumes them in carnal pleaſures in chambering and wantonneſs, in braveries and prodigality, in drunkenneſs and glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, in dicing and whoring, in haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and hunting, and in ſenſualities and vanities, and other like: miſerable wretches continually heap them up, and have not the grace to make uſe of them,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:122164:34"/>but famiſh themſelves in the midſt of their treaſures, whereas they might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other do good to their native Countrey, relieve the poor, and abound in works of charity, whereby it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſeen, that riches are as a ſtumbling block to the ways of righteouſneſs; and it is confirmed by theſe words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 19.23.</note> 
                  <hi>A rich man ſhall hardly enter in the kingdom of heaven;</hi> for rich men are for the greater part ſo beſotted with their riches, that their gold and ſilver is their Idol, to whom they ſacrifice morning and evening, nay day and night, the beſt of their cogitations and thoughts; and rather then they will part from them, will hazard the ſalvation of their ſouls, as it may appear by the carriage of the young man ſpoken of in the Goſpel; for when our Saviour ſaid unto him,<note n="g" place="margin">Luke 18.22, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Go and ſell all that thou haſt, and diſtribute the ſame unto the poor, and thou ſhalt have a treaſure in heaven, and come and follow me; he went away,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>very ſorrowful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was very rich:</hi> for their hearts be ſo glued to the things of this world, and their mindes ſo taken up with cark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cares to increaſe or preſerve their riches, that they have no time to attend
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:122164:34"/>carefully upon the hearing of the Word of God; and ſuppoſe they frequent (as other men) do the publique exerciſes, yet their mindes are ſo bent upon their worldly affairs, that they are not atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Word, and do not apply it to themſelves, and ſo neglect to make their calling and election ſure: And for Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, daily experience doth ſhew, that the greater part of them are inferior to others in that excellent grace, for they above all others are full of malice, envy, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, and will upon the leaſt offence, or unadviſed word undo poor men by tedious ſuits at law to vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, preſumption and pride being as a natural habit to rich men, and theſe are the greateſt Antagoniſts to charity: and for their charity towards the poor, they are alſo generally more cloſe-fiſted then the middle ſort of men, for charity is not to be valued by the gift: a man that giveth ſix pence a week to the poor, may be more charitable then another that gives five ſhillings a weeke, becauſe that ſix pence may be more, according to the Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticall proportion to his eſtate, then five ſhillings is to the wealth of a rich man: and that was the reaſon that the

                  <p>Of the vanity of worldly pleaſures.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere is alſo two ſorts of pleaſure: firſt, the Worldly: ſecondly, the Spiritual; the laſt are rather ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual raviſhments then pleaſures, for their ſuperlative excellency: but the worldly pleaſures are like the morning dew, that vaniſheth away at the riſing of the Sun; even ſo worldly pleaſures have no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:122164:38"/>and in the continuance they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come irkſome; and yet is one of the dieties of worldly men, in the injoyment of which, they conceive doth conſiſt their ſupream good: Their original ſpring is the five ſenſes: firſt, the Sight: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Hearing: thirdly, the Taſt: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Smel: fifthly, the Feeling: and every one of theſe have their peculiar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights: the Sight takes pleaſure in beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful objects, the Hearing in Muſick, the Taſt in delicious Savors, the Smel in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deriferous Odours, and the hand in laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Feelings; ſo that all the worldly pleaſures that can be imagined proceed from one of theſe ſenſes: how can it then be poſſible, that rational men ſhould be ſo mad as to conceive their ſupream good ſhould conſiſt in ſuch momentary vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties! beſides, it is daily ſeen, that mens pleaſures are rather guided by Phanſie then by Reaſon, and more by inclination, then judgment; for what is pleaſant to one is diſtaſtful to the other throughout the five ſenſes: Firſt, in the Objects, ſome love a flaxen hair'd, others a black hair'd woman: ſome love to hear a doleful melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, others a joyful: ſome love to eat one thing, and ſome another; nay, their very
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:122164:38"/>taſte will vary, although they eat of one and the ſame meate: ſome love a ſweet, milde odour, others a ſtrong perfume; and for their Feeling, they are as various; and in the Election of their calling they differ as much, ſome love a Souldiers life, others love Learning, others to be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, other Shop-keepers; others will be Artificers, others will be Sea-faring men, others will feed cattel, and others will till the ground: Likewiſe in their Recreations, ſome love Hawking, others Hunting, others Shooting, others Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, others Gaming, and ſo in all things their pleaſures differ &amp; varie. If it be then granted, that their ſupream Good doth conſiſt in the injoyment of their pleaſures, then there muſt of neceſſity be as many different ſupream Goods, as there is varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of pleaſures; but as I have ſaid before, all theſe pleaſures or inclinations, are but meer phanſies, vanities, and vexations of Spirit; as it ſhall be proved by theſe inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſes: Obſerve then for method ſake, that worldly pleaſures may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed thus,
<list>
                     <item>1. By neceſſary and natural.</item>
                     <item>2. By violent and ſuperfluous.</item>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:122164:39"/>
                     <item>3. By moderate and lawful.</item>

               </p>
               <p>And for concluſion, I will give a hint of the ſpiritual Pleaſures that are ſuperexcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and free from vanity.</p>
               <p>Firſt, under the neceſſary pleaſures are compriſed eating, drinking, walking, reſting and ſleeping, with the actions and imployments about our juſt and lawful Callings, for in all theſe things there is a naturall delight, for he that eateth when he is ahungry, and drinieth when he is athirſt, and reſteth when he is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or ſleepeth after a long watching, finds a delight in all theſe neceſſary things, without which men cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, but in all theſe men are to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, otherwiſe they become vitious, but they muſt be laborious in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; therefore as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,<note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 5.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Sleep to a labouring man is ſweet;</hi> as Souldiers in their Military exerciſes, Students in their Studies,<note place="margin">The neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</note> Merchants in their Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Shop-keepers in their Shops, and Artificers in their Work, otherwiſe their profeſſions will ſeem tedious and irkſome unto them; and as a rowling ſtone ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver getteth Moſs, ſo fickle and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:122164:39"/>men in their calling never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to honor nor riches, for it is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, activity, and a conſtant aſſiduity in in any profeſſion that make men thrive in the world; <hi>He becometh poor,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Pro. 10.4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>that dealeth with a ſlack hand, but the hand of the diligent maketh rich; he that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth in Summer is a wiſe ſon, but he that ſleepeth in Harveſt is a ſon of ſhame:</hi> and many men in theſe days come to penury by often changing of Calling, or by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking ſuch Callings as they never were bred to, or by exerciſing four or five Callings at one and the ſame time, which is a great vanity, for that is the cauſe that Artificers never attain to the perfection of their Art, or handy-craft, but remain ignorant hudlers in them all: It is therefore convenient that men ſhould be conſtant to one Calling, and to take delight in it, <hi>For godlineſs with content,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">1 Tim. 6.6.</note> 
                  <hi>is great gain,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out men take delight in their profeſſion, they will always be changing till they bring themſelves to extream miſery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, violent and ſuperfluous Pleaſures are deſructive two ways, the firſt impair mens health, and ſhorten their dayes, and the other doth waſte and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:122164:40"/>conſume their eſtates: how many have loſt their lives by the exceſſive pleaſures of Venery in the very act, &amp; many more by exceſſive riots of drunkenneſs and glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and others by the violent exerciſes of Tennis, Foot-ball play, Leaping, Vault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and running of races: ſome others by ſwiming,<note place="margin">The violent and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</note> and others by drinking in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wines cooled in ſnow; and of late years how many have ſhortned their lives by the exceſſive uſe of Tobacco, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching herb, in the taking of which the poorer ſort conſume the ſmall means they have, and the richer impair their health, and fill their brains as full of foot, as is the funnel of a chimney, by which they deprive themſelves of ſleep, conſume their radical humor, engender Palſies, and apoplexies, and go down to the grave before their time, whereas if it be uſed moderately, it purgeth the Phlegm, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the Dropſie, and refreſheth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. It is then apparent, that as theſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pleaſures impair the body, ſo they waſt mens eſtates, for rioting, gluttony and drunkenneſs, Tennis, and Foot-ball<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play, running of races, and drinking of wine cooled in ſnow are conſumers of the means and eſtates of men.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:122164:40"/>
               <p>Thirdly, the moderate and lawful pleaſures, are not prohibited in the word of God, ſo they be uſed with moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for Chriſtians may boldly take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in a moderate way of all the creatures under the Sun, ſo it be with thankſgiving, and after a ſanctified manner in all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and temperance. 1. They may take delight in the admirable works of God,<note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 136.8.</note> in the contemplation of the light of the Sun, in the conſtant courſe it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in the regulating of the ſeaſons of the year, and in the increaſe and declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its heigth, whereby the days are lengthened or ſhortned; In the various mutations of the Moon, by whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the Tides increaſe or fall. 2. They may delight to ſee the aſpect of the Spring<note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 8.3.</note> when after a cold Winter the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative creatures begin to ſprout, and when <hi>Flora</hi> doth reveſt her ſelf in her glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious apparel clothing the earth with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of odiferous flowers inameled of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers colours, which excel in beauty, in the eſteem of our bleſſed Saviour,<note n="f" place="margin">Math. 6.28.</note> the very glory of King <hi>Salomon;</hi> and in Summer they may delight in the bleſſing of God, upon the labour of the Husbandman; and in Harveſt upon the incredible increaſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:122164:41"/>of the ſeed, and in Winter<note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 72.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

They may delight in the glorious objects of the green and beautiful medows, and in the ſweet rivers running along their banks; in the numerous herds of cattel feeding in the Valleys and Mountains. 4. They may rejoyce in the commerce and trade of rich merchandiſe that are brought from forraign parts, whereby the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth doth flouriſh, and the poor are ſet at work; and all in generall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of all neceſſary things for this life. 5. They may take delight to ſee the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, Shop-keepers, and all others of the poorer ſort to proſper, and to have vent and utterance for their wares, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are enabled to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, wives, children and ſervants, in a decent condition, and free from want or penury. 6. They may delight and bleſs
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:122164:41"/>the Lord, for their health, peace, and proſperous eſtate, and that they live, and move, and have a beeing, with all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things for this life, as meat, drink and raiment; but above all they may laud and praiſe the Lord for his mercy, and the free liberty they have to hear his Word and Goſpel preached with zeal and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. 7. They may ſolace themſelves in honeſt recreations, as in walking abroad to take the aire, in the company of their friends; their diſcourſes being<note n="h" place="margin">Col. 4 6.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeaſoned with ſalt,</hi> and rather tending to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then depravation. 8. They may ſometimes go a hunting, hawking, fiſhing, ſhooting, bowling, but theſe recreations are to be ſhort, and onely for to refreſh their ſpirits, after tedious ſtudies, and weekly employments, and to ſtrengthen their bodies by theſe laudable exerciſes, and not to make them, as ſome do, their daily work, for otherwiſe theſe honeſt and laudable recreations would become vitious, and deſtructive to body and ſoul, for nothing ought to be more precious to Chriſtians then Time.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Vicious and unlawful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are the ſnares of Satan, and the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bengers of death, and yet they are moſt in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:122164:42"/>faſhion in theſe days,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</note> and few or none that are addicted to them, will give them any bound or limits: It is recorded that <hi>Ceſar, Edward</hi> the fourth King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth King of <hi>France,</hi> were over-much addicted to Venery, and yet thoſe that have written their Lives, give them this commendation, that they bounded this Paſſion within certain limits; for their Venerian delights did never, ſay they, make them neglect any affairs of State, or actions of war, becauſe, ſaith a modern Author of <hi>Ceſar,</hi>

                     <hi>Senault</hi> in the uſe of Paſſions.</note> that the Paſſion of Ambition was more predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in him then the Paſſion of Love, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Paſſion of Love, in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and of <hi>Senault</hi> himſelf, is held to be the moſt violent Paſſion of all the other Paſſions: but if men are to be moderated, as I have ſaid before, in the natural and neceſſary pleaſures, there is great reaſon they ſhould be more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in their vitious pleaſures, ſith they are ſinful, and odious to God, and to all vertuous and temperate men: and St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.3.</note> would have men to be moderate in their cating and drinking for their healths ſake, and for conſcience ſake, for the abuſe of the creature is prohibited by the Lord:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:122164:42"/>Nay, they are to be temperate in their walkings, reſting, ſleeping, and in the very delight of the Nuptiall bed, and that is the reaſon that St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives them this charge,<note n="k" place="margin">Phil. 4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Let your moderation be known unto all men: the Lord is at hand;</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding young and old run after vitious and unlawful pleaſures, as the Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound runs after the Hare, and yet they beſot men, and deprive men of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and judgment, and ſuch as by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome have gotten an habit in carnal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, are ſeldom weaned from them, without a ſpecial meaſure of divine grace, for they are more inticing, and have ſtronger charms to allure men (then the Harlot ſpoken of in the 7. of <hi>Proverbs,</hi>

But before I proceed, give me leave to examin what bliſs or feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city doth conſiſt in the injoyment of theſe vanities.

               <p>THe next aggravation of the vanity of the lives of men, after the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer deſcription of the vanity of their deſires, is the vanity of their paſſions, with the exorbitant care they take for the cure of their bodily diſeaſes, and their unparallel'd careleſneſs of the cure of the maladies of their ſouls; for what greater vanity can there be, then to prefer the health of their body that is momentary and nothing but duſt, to the preſervation of the welfare and tranquillity of their immortall ſouls, who are in the eſteem of our bleſſed Saviour,<note n="a" place="margin">Mar. 8.37</note> ſuch a precious Jewel that there is nothing under the Sun, that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:122164:46"/>for value may be given in exchange for it: and yet it is daily ſeen, that if their finger doth but ake, or if they have but a quotidian ague, (that is a wholſom medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in the Spring) they will preſently take their bed, and ſend for the beſt Phyſitians, and will ingenuouſly declare unto them the ſymptoms of their diſeaſe, that they may the better preſcribe fit remedies for the cure of it: but if their ſouls be ſick, by the rageful diſtempers of their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which breed ſtorms of preturbations in their ſoules, as the impetuous windes do tempeſts at ſea, they make nothing of it, neither will they ſend for a ſpiritual Phyſitian, that can pour in their feſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red wounds the Balm of<note n="b" place="margin">Jer. 8.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Gilead,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage by their grave Counſels the fury of their paſſions, but will rather, if any come to viſit them, unſent for, diſguiſe their vicious paſſions, by the names of vertues, for they commonly call Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition a deſire of Glory, and Avarice a prudent fore-caſt; and the furious paſſion of wrath a generoſity of courage, and ſo of all the reſt: and by this concealing and diſguiſhing of their ſpiritual mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, make them by cuſtome utterly incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:122164:46"/>induced divers learned Authors, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe in their Writings, divers excellent remedies to cure theſe concealed maladies of the ſoul: but before I ſpeak of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, it is fit the Reader ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the eſſentiall cauſe of theſe diſtempers, for as it is impoſſible for a Phyſitian to cure the bodily infirmities of his patient before he be acquainted with the nature of them; even ſo it is far more impoſſible for the Reader to pacifie the fury of his paſſions, before he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by theſe inſuing particulars of the cauſe and nature of them.

               <p>Secondly, Becauſe this Senſitive power is diſtinguiſhed into two diſtinct appetites, <hi>viz.</hi> the Concupiſcible, and the Iraſcible, which are properly the faculties that the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Appetitives,</hi> which intimates in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue an aptneſs,<note place="margin">See <hi>Beau-lieu</hi> in his Body of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, <hi>pa.</hi> 721.</note> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, or natural inclination, inticing men and beaſt to purſue ſuch objects as ſeem Good, or to fly from ſuch objects that ſeem to be Evil; and the truth is,<note place="margin">The propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of the Concupiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Iraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites.</note> that the propriety of the Concupiſcible appetite is to induce men to proſecute the objects that ſeem ſimply to be Good, or to draw them back from ſuch that ſeem ſimply to be Evil, who have no appearance in them to be difficult to be obtained, or to be avoided: and the propriety of the Iraſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appetite is to intice men to meet the objects preſented by the ſenſes unto them after a ſhort reſult of the imagination that be not onely ſimply good or evil, but full of difficulties to obtain or to eſchew; for the ſeeming good ſimply,<note place="margin">See <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Phyſio. <hi>lib.</hi> 16. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> is the proper object of the Concupiſcible appetite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is pleaſant and uſeful to men or beaſt, and may be obtained without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; but the ſeeming good that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently difficult to obtain, and the evil
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:122164:48"/>that is hard to avoid, is the proper object of the Iraſcible appetite: But you are in this place to take notice once for all, That the objects that the ſenſes repreſent to mens phanſies, or imaginations are not always really good, nor really evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the judgments of men are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deluded by the ſenſes, who varniſh over the good with evil, and the evil with good; and that is the reaſon why this phraſe of ſeeming good, or ſeeming evil, is uſed ſo often in theſe Diſcourſes.</p>

                  </note> Paſſions argues imperfection in the ſubject, and a diſtemper in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive power of the ſoul: and here is the definition of the general words of Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>Paſsion is nothing but a motion of the ſenſitive appetite proceeding from the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of a reall or ſeeming good or evil, which begets an alteration in the body againſt the law of Nature:</hi> Mens paſſions are born with them, and therefore cannot be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguiſhed, neither by an habit of moral Vertue, nor by Grace; but their ſury may be allaid, and their diſtemper regulated; they never ariſe but there is an apparent alteration of the body, as it is noted in the deſinition above related, and this alteration proceeds after this maner,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:122164:48"/>the objects having been repreſented to the imagination by the ſenſes; if it conceives them to be good; the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcible appetite doth intice men to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute theſe objects, and having obtained their deſire, there proceeds from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it, a paſſion of joy and delight, which dilates the blood, with the vital ſpirits that reſide in it to the extreameſt part of the body; and the heart being deprived of ſome of his natural heat, makes an alteration in the body, that is apparently ſeen in the face, which hath by it a more pleaſant aſpect, and a more ruddy complexion then ordinary; but if this delight or joy be violent and come unexpectedly, it makes a contrary altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the face, for then it becomes pale, and the body falls into a ſwound,<note place="margin">That mens paſſions cauſe varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in the body.</note> and ſometimes deprives the party of life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſuddain violence of the paſſion, hath driven all the blood and vital ſpirits from the heart, and ſo for want of heat the life is extinguiſhed. Contrarily, if the objects procure a paſſion of fear, then the blood and the vital ſpirits reſident in it, with-draw from the extream parts of the body, and aſcend up to the heart to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort the ſame, and ſtir up the paſſion of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:122164:49"/>undantedneſs to oppoſe this fear, but in the mean time, this irregular motion of the heart, and the running of the blood cauſeth an apparent alteration in the body, for the face and all the members of the body loſe their natural complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and become pale, the knees, feet, and hands trembling, as if the party had the dead-palſey. Nay, if this paſſion be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and happen unexpectedly, it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the party of life, for it will bring up ſuch a ſuperfluous current of blood and vital ſpirits about the heart, that it will be ſmothered by it, as it ſhall be proved by divers inſtances in convenient time and place. But ſome will object, How can the powers of the ſoul ſympathize thus with the accidents that happen to the body? I anſwer, that it is by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication that is between the Senſitive power of the ſoul, and the organs of the body, as it appears in the paſſions of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Dolour; for if a man injoy any pleaſure, the ſenſitive power of the ſoul hath her part of this delight; likewiſe if his body be racked, the ſenſitive power of his ſoul ſuffers her part of the torments, for the body and the ſoul is but one <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual,</hi> the body without a ſoul being
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:122164:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>but a lump of clay, the one being the matter, and the other the form; or the the body is the Bulk of the ſhip, and the ſoul the Helm that guideth the ſame.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">That the heart is the ſeat of mens paſſions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Phyſiogn. <hi>lib.</hi> 16.</note> the paſſions of men are ſeated in the heart, becauſe it is the ſeat of the Senſitive power from which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived: and this is the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and other ancient and modern Authors: yet divers are of another judgment, ſome would have the ſeat of them to be in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, others in the gall, others in the ſpleen: but, becauſe the reaſons &amp; arguments they uſe to prove their opinion, have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed for erronious, I will not trouble you with them, ſpecially ſith our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour doth confirm by theſe words,<note n="d" place="margin">Matth. 7.21.</note> that they are ſeated in the heart, <hi>For from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, out of the heart proceeds evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>As for the number of the paſſions of men, it is uncertain, for they may be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by the limitation of their objects, as the windes have been of late: for at the firſt they were but four, the Eaſt, North, Weſt, and South, and then they were multiplied to eight, and afterwards to ſixteen, and then to two and thirty, and of late they have been multiplied to three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and four: as for the paſſions, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was of opinion that there was but one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral paſſion, and that was <hi>Love:</hi> Others ſaid there were but two, and they were <hi>Delight,</hi> and <hi>Dolour;</hi> others ſaid there were but four, and they were <hi>Ioy, Sorrow, Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear;</hi> and this opinion was grounded upon reaſon, for whatſoever men act or undertake, they <hi>delight, grieve, fear</hi> or <hi>hope.</hi>

               <p>Theſe eleven general paſſions, and all others that derive from them, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſix heads; three incident to the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:122164:51"/>Concupiſcible appetite, and three to the Iraſcible; the three of the Concupiſcible have every one of them their Oppoſites. Firſt, <hi>Love</hi> hath for his oppoſite <hi>Hatred.</hi> Secondly, the <hi>Deſire</hi> hath for his oppoſite the <hi>Flight.</hi> Thirdly,<note place="margin">See <hi>Beau-Lieu, p.</hi> 724.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioy</hi> hath for its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite <hi>Dolour:</hi> but the paſſions of the Iraſcible have but two oppoſites, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Hope</hi> hath for his oppoſite <hi>Deſpair.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Vndantedneſs</hi> hath for his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite <hi>Fear,:</hi> but <hi>Wrath</hi> hath no oppoſite; If you will know the reaſons, read <hi>Beau-Lieu,</hi> in his Body of Philoſophy, for I cut them off for brevity ſake. Theſe ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven generall paſſions may be multiplied by the limitation of their objects to be as numerous as a ſwarm of Bees.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The original ſpring of the paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, is the ſenſes, which are: firſt, the Sight: ſecondly, the Odour: thirdly, the Hearing: fourthly, the Taſt: fifthly, the Feeling; and they ariſe and ſpring up af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this maner: The Senſes having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the Objects to the Fanſies, or imaginations of men,<note place="margin">The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſpring of the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men is the Senſes.</note> after a ſhort reſult of the rational part: the Concupiſcible appetite doth intice men to proſecute the reall or ſeeming Good; and the Iraſcible appetite doth induce them to proſecute
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:122164:52"/>the Good, compaſſed with difficulties, or to fly from the apparent or ſeeming Evil. Now by this purſuit of the Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcible appetite, or by the flight of the Iraſcible appetite; the heart which is the ſpring of all the motions of the body, muſt of neceſſity be diſtempered; and from this diſtemper proceeds the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the body that I have ſpoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which have been noted to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of Nature: for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural temper of the heart, of ſuch as are in perfect health, and that are free from the motions that ariſe from their paſſions, is more equal (as it may appear by the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Pulſe, which is the ſureſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence men have, of the temper or diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the heart) then the ballance of the moſt excellent Watch upon earth: and the heart being once brought out of his natural temper, the foreſaid alterations are greater or leſſe, according to the degree of the diſtemper of the heart; which are ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in ſome paſſions, that they are viſibly ſeen in the ſtrange poſtures of the body; the high colour of the face, the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the eyes, or by the ſhrilneſs, and fierceneſs of the voyce. Beſides, theſe alterations proceeding from the paſsions,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:122164:52"/>there is a continual contention between the forementioned Concupiſcible and Iraſcible appetites in the will of men, which is the cauſe of the anxiety and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of the minde, which ſhall be deſcribed in the next Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the evil effects of the paſsions of men ariſe from their contentions one with another, and their good effects ariſe from the aſsiſtance they give one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fly from evil, for to cleave to the good; The Deſire, that is a paſsion inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Concupiſcible appetite is a great inticer to ſin, and therefore it is called by St. <hi>John,</hi>

                  <hi>The luſt of the eye,</hi> and by St. <hi>Paul</hi>

                  <hi>The luſt of concupiſcence;</hi> and by this paſsion of the luſt of the eyes was <hi>David</hi> inticed to commit the hainous ſin of adultery with<note n="f" place="margin">2 Sam. 11.2, 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> the wife to <hi>Vriah</hi> the <hi>Hittite;</hi> Now had Flight come to his aid as it did to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when his lewd Miſtreſs did tempt him to luſt, it had been an excellent effect of that paſsion. It is likely that there was then a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention between the Concupiſcible and the Iraſcible appetite, the firſt inticing King <hi>David</hi> to ſin by the repreſentation of ſo beautiful an object, and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of ſuch a ſeeming good; and the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:122164:53"/>ſecond by perſwading him to eſchue and fly from this apparent evil varniſhed over with a ſeeming good; but what became of their great contention, but a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation in the minde of <hi>David</hi> for a time? yet had the Concupiſcible appetite the maſtery, for <hi>David</hi> did injoy his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and remained impenitent a whole year:<note n="f" place="margin">2 Sam. 12.13.</note> but when he was awaked from this ſpiritual lethargie by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> he cried, out of a penitent heart, <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord:</hi> this was then an evil effect of this paſsion of Deſire. The paſsion of fear that did poſſeſs Saint <hi>Peter</hi> when our bleſſed Saviour was brought into the Hall of the High Prieſt, cauſed another evil effect, for it did intice St. <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Matth. 26.70, 71, 72, 75.</note> to deny his Lord and Maſter three times before <hi>the Cock crew;</hi> but it was a good effect of the paſsion of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> above cited, for it made him fly from ſin to preſerve his continency; and it was a noble effect of the paſsion of Undanted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that did poſſeſs the hearts of <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Dan. 13.19.</note> and of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Dan. 6.16.</note> to induce the three firſt to indure the torments of the fire of a burning furnace, heated ſeven times more then it was ordinarily: and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:122164:53"/>to deſpiſe the rage of the Lyons, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then diſobey the Commandment of the Lord. But theſe are but moral allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for it is not in the power of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcible appetite to make the children of God commit ſuch ſins as the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> did, but it was becauſe God was pleaſed to give them over to themſelves, to make them know that the perſeverance in grace is a free gift of his; neither is it in the power of the Iraſcible appetite to infuſe ſuch a continency as was found in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> nor ſuch an unparallel'd undantedneſs as was in <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach, Abednigo,</hi> and in <hi>Daniel;</hi> but it was the bleſſed Spirit of God that did infuſe in their hearts that admirable fortitude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>AS after a hard winter, the Sun is not onely ſeen to give a new life to all the Vegetative, Senſitive, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creatures upon earth; but alſo by the heat of his beams to penetrate the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:122164:54"/>very bowels of the earth, for to purifie the inſenſible creatures from their droſs, as the ſilver, gold, and precious ſtones; even ſo after mens paſsions have by their natural commotions, clouded their mindes with a Winter of anxiety and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: ſupernatural Love, doth not onely revive their Spirits, but doth alſo purifie them from the droſs that theſe perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had left behinde them in their ſouls. Love being then the moſt noble paſsion of men, it is fit it ſhould have the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in theſe Diſcourſes, ſith without love all humane ſociety ſhould be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and by it men deprived of all content and comfort in this life; for the greateſt comfort that men can attain to in this vale of Tears, is to have a conſtant friend, or a faithful conſort, in whoſe breſt they may confide their greateſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and be partaker with them of their proſperity, honor, and glory, or ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with them in their afflictions and miſeries.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:122164:54"/>
                  <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that were then held for their valour to be invincible, regarding more the content and honor that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (whom he loved intirely) ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of it, then his own; and certainly the greateſt fruit that men can receive of their proſperity, is, when their friends rejoyce and partake of it, and the greateſt comfort they can have in their afflictions, is when they are aſſured to have friends that ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with their miſeries. Now the paſsion of Love being of ſuch concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will for the better deſcription of it ſpeak in order of theſe particulars: firſt, of the definition of Love: ſecondly, of the eſſentiall cauſe of Love: thirdly, of the variety or kinds of Love: fourthly, of the end or intereſt of mens Love: fifthly, of the qualities required in men for to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Love: ſixthly, of the good, and bad effects of Love: ſeventhly, of the Love of God towards men: eighthly, of the Love of men to God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Love is nothing elſe but to wiſh good to another, not for mens own intereſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Definition of love ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Senault.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>but for the good and merit of the party beloved, to whom men are to procure all the good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that ſhall be in their power.</hi> Upon which definition obſerve theſe four Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:122164:55"/>firſt, that Love doth ever unite the Heart and Will of men to the party beloved; And therefore the ancients ſaid commonly that <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Epheſtion</hi> had but one ſoul in two diſtinct bodies, becauſe their joy and glory, ſorrow or diſgrace was mutuall to them both: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Mens love is not to be grounded upon the pleaſure or profit they may receive by them they ſeem to love; for it can be no love, except their love be grounded upon the vertues and merits of the party beloved: thirdly, Lovers are to wiſh and procure the good and honor of their beloved, and to require nothing of them but what they may do with honor and equity: fourthly, The goods and lives of men are to be at the diſpoſing of the party beloved, Honor, Religion, and Loyalty onely excepted, for true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip doth not oblige men to blemiſh their honor, rack their conſcience, nor to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray their Prince at the requeſt of their beloved, becauſe theſe requeſts are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of love, which is only to be confined within the limits of Vertue;<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls.</note> and therefore the ancient Moraliſt highly commends this ſaying of a Heathen, who ſaid to his friend, who did require him to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:122164:55"/>perjure himſelf, I am, ſaith he, thy friend untill the Altar: and the like anſwer was given to <hi>Charls</hi> Duke of <hi>Burbon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Du Belay</hi> Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,</note> when he did intreate his noble friends, to ſide with him againſt his and their natural Prince, <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, King of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The cauſe of Love is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by ſome to be a ſympathy, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination that inticeth men to love one man before another, for it is often ſeen, that when a man comes in the company of other men he never had ſeen before, he will affect one of that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more then any of the reſt, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, ſay they, from a ſympathy of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that is between theſe two men. Others conceive that the cauſe of Love doth conſiſt in the influence of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and for proof of their Opinions ſay, that the love of <hi>Achilles</hi> to <hi>Patroclus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Homer. <hi>See</hi> Quinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Curtius.</note> and of <hi>Alexander</hi> to the <hi>Amazon</hi> Queen, was becauſe they were born under one and the ſame Planet. Others conceive the cauſe of Love to be the intimate conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and familiarity of the parties, which by an habit and cuſtom begets love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Others conceive that the goodneſs and beauty of the object is the cauſe of love; and with theſe I concur in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:122164:56"/>Opinion, for God who is the Beauty and Goodneſs it ſelf, is certainly the eſſential cauſe of true love.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, All ſorts of love may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed under natural and ſupernatural, the natural hath divers branches, that may all be reduced under the love of Intereſt, and the love of Friendſhip, of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter, when I have ſet forth the Opinion of thoſe, who maintain there is five ſeverall ſorts of Love: firſt, the love of the innanimate creatures: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the love of the ſenſitive creatures: thirdly, the love of the rational creatures: fourthly, the love of Angels: fifthly, the love of God: firſt, The love of the innani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate creatures, is apparent in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the perfection of their beeing, the light ones aſcending upwards, and the heavy ones deſcending downwards, as to their center: ſecondly, The love of the ſenſitive creatures, is an impreſſion wrought by the ſenſes in their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the objects it conceives to beuſeful unto them, which begetteth a deſire to injoy them; and this paſsion is not onely incident to the bruit creatures, but alſo to the rational, who are overcome by the ſenſitive appetite: thirdly, The love of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:122164:56"/>the reaſonable creatures ſhould be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Reaſon, becauſe it is inlightned by the Underſtanding, the ſeat of the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power of the ſoul: but becauſe the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive power doth oftentimes get the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, it ſtraies from its right end, that is properly to endeavor to attain to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream good, the very end why men were created; but ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall men are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by the violence of their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to greater inconveniencies and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers then they which ride upon untamed Colts, their love being no more a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate motion of their Will, but an effect of their paſſions: fourthly, The love of Angels doth far excel the love of men, becauſe they are the bleſſed Spirits, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending day and night before the Throne of God, to execute his Will and Pleau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſpecially to protect his Elect; now as the onely object of their love is God, who is the perfection of Beauty and Goodneſs, their love muſt of neceſſity be more excellent then the love of the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creatures: fifthly, The love of God towards mankinde, for excellency is ſo ſuperlative over the love of men and Angels, that it will admit of no compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, his beeing infinite and theirs finite, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:122164:57"/>therefore I will deſiſt to ſpeak of it at this preſent: for the Love I am to ſpeak of, is the love of Intereſt, and the love of Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The end and Intereſt of mens Love is of a large extent: for many do ſeem to love ſuch that can prefer them, to the injoyment of honors, riches, and pleaſures: but the Love grounded upon theſe ſandy foundations, is but a fained and mercenary love: <hi>Sejanus</hi> the Favorite of the Emperor,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Tacitus, Suetonius, <hi>and</hi> Dion.</note> 
                  <hi>Tiberius</hi> was adored as the morning Sun is by the <hi>Indians,</hi> by the greateſt Senators and men of war of the Empire, as long as he was in favor and could prefer his Clients to places of honor or gain, but as ſoon as he fell in diſgrace, they became his greateſt perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors. <hi>Haman</hi> the Favorite of King <hi>Ahaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus</hi> was worſhipped by the Officers that ſate at the Kings gate, <hi>Mordecai</hi> onely excepted, but when he fell into diſgrace, theſe very Officers informed the King that he had erected a gibbit of fifty cubits to hang up<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſther</hi> 3.2. and 7.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Mordecai;</hi> upon which infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation the King commanded, they ſhould inſtantly hang <hi>Haman</hi> upon the ſame gibbit, and having readily perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this command, the ſaid men pillaged
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:122164:57"/>his houſe and rich moveables. If Love be grounded upon Beauty, it cannot be of any continuance; what is more ſubject to accidents then Beauty? the Meaſles, the ſmall Pox, or old Age, will disfigure the greateſt Beauty. But the love of true friendſhip, having no other object then the vertue and merit of the beloved party remaineth permenant, and rather increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth then diminiſheth by age. But ſome will object, Many in theſe days that profeſs to be our greateſt friends, are our greateſt enemies, how ſhall we then be able to diſtinguiſh theſe counterfeit friends from the reall: They may be diſcerned by theſe evidences: firſt, if they rejoyce when thou rejoyceſt, and mourn when thou mourneſt, not in ſhew but in heart: ſecondly, If they are as ſerviceable in thy adverſity as in thy proſperity, for if they reſpect thee in proſperity, and reject thee in thy poverty, they are but fained friends: thirdly, If they are as eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to a ſimple Meal, as to a great Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, for there are too many Table-friends in theſe days: if they love thoſe thou loveſt, and hate thoſe thou hateſt, for otherwiſe their affections do not ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with thine, and there can be no
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:122164:58"/>true love where an antipathy of affections raigns: fifthly, If the defamation of thy honor, or good name be as tender unto them as it is to thee; and whether they will be as apt to vindicate the ſame when opportunity ſerve as thou wilt, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thou canſt not be dear unto them, who make no account of thy infamy: ſixthly, If they take in good part thy reproofs, and acknowledg them to proceed from thy love to them, rather then from a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious auſterity: many other Evidences might be given, but theſe ſhall ſerve for brevity ſake.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the qualities required in men to obtain Love are numerous; for <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Phyſ.</hi> makes mention of fifteen, and yet there be many more, but Piety, Vertue, Goodneſs and Beauty are four of the principal: firſt, Piety draws the love of God as the Adamant ſtone draws the Needle; and ſuch as are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored with the love of God are bleſſed, and need not fear the hatred of men, <hi>For if God be with us, who ſhall be againſt us?</hi> ſecondly, Vertue is ſuch a Jewel, that all men and women that are endowed with Vertue are never without lovers, nay, their very enemies love them: <hi>Tilligny</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:122164:58"/>for his rare Vertues was reſcued from death by his greateſt enemies at the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre of <hi>Paris:</hi> thirdly,<note place="margin">See the <hi>French</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory in the life of <hi>Charis</hi> the ninth.</note> Goodneſs is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency of Piety and Vertue; for good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to them as the ſhadow is to the body, and therefore it is never without lovers: fourthly, Beauty, although it be but a fading gift of Nature, hath not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding more lovers then any of the former, for men are bewitched by the raies of Beauty; the comlineſs and beauty of <hi>Abſolom</hi> inſnared the love of <hi>David</hi> unto him, and although he had neither Piety, nor Vertue, it made him cry out<note n="b" place="margin">Sam. 18.33.</note> 
                  <hi>O Abſolom, Abſolom, Abſolom my ſon, would to God I had died for thee:</hi> fifthly, ſuch as execute unpartial Juſtice are belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all men, as <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Fabritius:</hi> ſixthly, Valour makes men to be beloved, if they imploy the ſame for to free their Native Countrey from oppreſſion, as <hi>Jepthy</hi> and <hi>Gedion:</hi> ſeventhly, Liberal men are beloved, as <hi>Mecaenas</hi> was of all the learned men of his time: eighthly, Grateful men are beloved, for ingratitude is abhorred of God and men, for the very bruit beaſts are grateful to their benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, witneſs the gratitude of the Lyon towards the <hi>Roman</hi> Slave, who ſaved his
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:122164:59"/>life for curing of his paw:<note place="margin">See <hi>Livius</hi> in his 1. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade.</note> ninthly, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers are beloved, as <hi>Mamercus</hi> was for reconciling the People with the <hi>Patrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> tenthly, Godly and Religious men that conſtantly ſtand to their Principles, are beloved, as <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> for although he was exiled divers times, yet was he ever protected, and found friends where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he came: eleventhly, Merciful men are beloved,<note place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> as <hi>Ceſar</hi> was for his clemency: twelfthly, The cheriſhers of Learning are beloved, as was <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, King of <hi>France:</hi> thirteenthly, Men of a ſweet, pleaſant, and complying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation are beloved, as <hi>Epheſtion</hi> was of <hi>Alexander:</hi> fourteenthly, Men free from diſſimulation, who ſpeak what they think to be good for their native Country are beloved,<note place="margin">See <hi>Tacitus.</hi>
                  </note> as <hi>Tracia</hi> was in <hi>Veſpaſians</hi> days: fifteenthly, Men love courteous and ſerviceable men that are ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend them upon all occaſions, and by this <hi>Abſolom</hi>

               <p>Seventhly, The Love of God towards men is altogether incomprehenſible, as it will appear by theſe expreſſions of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:122164:61"/>bleſſed Spirit, <hi>For God,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 3.6.</note>

                  <hi>Beloved, let us love one another, for love cometh of God, and every man that loveth is born of God: he that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is Love. In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe that God ſent his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins: Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if God ſo loved us, we ought alſo to love one another: no man hath ſeen God at any time; if we love one another God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us: hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his ſpirit. And we have ſeen, and do teſtify, that the Father ſent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.</hi> Theſe words of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the later end of this Chapter do confirm the Point, that Gods Love is the Adamant ſtone that draweth our love to him, and that we cannot of our ſelves
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:122164:61"/>love him before he be pleaſed to love us.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, As for the love of man towards God, it comes infinitely ſhort of Gods love towards them; for if any love God, it is a gift of his free grace, and God hath loved his elect before the creation of the world; and St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 9.13</note> doth give us a clear inſtance for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13. <hi>For God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>loved</hi> Jacob, <hi>and hated</hi> Eſau <hi>from their mothers womb:</hi> and the heart of<note n="b" place="margin">1 Sam. 13.14.</note>

And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the choiſe and election of Gods faithful ones, we have divers inſtances of it in his Word: for <hi>Moſes</hi>

               <p>THis Paſſion is the oppoſite of Love, and yet without Love and it nature could not be perfect, nor the world ſubſiſt; for if the divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence were not pleaſed to make uſe of the Natural averſion that is between the Elements, this univerſal Fabrick of the World would ſoon return to its firſt <hi>Chaos:</hi> And without this paſſion of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred men might juſtly complain of Nature, to have onely given them an inclination to purſue the good, and not an averſion to eſchew the evil.

And would they make uſe of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred for the end it was created, they would finde it a moſt uſeful paſſion for the propagation of a godly life, as it will appear at the end of this Chapter: but for the better deſcription of this paſſion, I intreate the Reader to obſerve theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing particulars as they are ſet in order.</p>

               <p>Firſt for the better deſcription of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this paſſion, I will ſet down divers definitions of it, according to the different opinions of the beſt Authors. <hi>Hatred is an averſion and a deteſtation or horror, that men have againſt all ſuch things as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:122164:63"/>in their imagination to be contrary to their good, and oppoſite to their content.</hi>

                  <hi>Or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is a deteſtation or horror of the ſenſitive appetite againſt ſuch things as it conceives to be hurtful and diſtaſtful to the Senſes, and to its content, or deſtructive to its Beeing; even as the Hatred or antipathy there is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally between the Sheep and the Woolf. As Love, ſaith another, is a certain ſympathy of the Senſitive appetite with ſuch things as are ſutable and convenient to Nature; even ſo Hatred is an antipathy of the Senſitive appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite againſt ſuch things as are diſtaſtful to the Senſes, or contrary to mens good, or deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to their Beeing. And as Love is of two ſorts,</hi> viz. <hi>The firſt, True Love and Amity,</hi>

                  <hi>called the love of Friendſhip: Secondly, Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Love, called Luſt: ſo there is two ſorts of Hatred.</hi> viz. <hi>The hatred of Deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Horror: ſecondly, the hatred of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; the laſt being far inferior to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; for to deteſt and abhor, is the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Hatred.</hi> Senault ſaith, That <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is nothing elſe but a meer averſion in us, from whatſoever is contrary unto us; or an antipathy of our appetite to a ſubject which diſpleaſeth it:</hi>

                  </note> all which definitions come neer unto one and the ſame ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Moraliſts are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:122164:64"/>there is four ſorts of Hatred: firſt, The Vegetative: ſecondly, The Brute: thirdly, The Melancholick: fourthly, the Humane: but the Divines add to theſe four the Spiritual Hatred, of which I ſhall ſpeak towards the later end of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: firſt, The Vegetative is apparent in the Plants, as between the Cabbage and the Vine, and between the Oak and the Ivy: ſecondly, The Brute, is to be ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sheep and the Woolf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Cock and the Lyon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Baſilisk, the Panther, and Mankinde;<note place="margin">See <hi>Plinius</hi> in his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hiſtory.</note> for the Naturaliſts ſay, That if a man ſee a Baſilisk, that the Baſilisk dies by the glance of his eyes, but if the Baſilisk ſee the man firſt, he falls down dead: And it is Recorded, that the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth ſo deteſt and abhor man, out of a natural hatred, that the Hunters that ſeek after him do commonly ſet the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of a man againſt an Oak, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde it their ſnares to catch him, for he hath no ſooner diſcovered this Picture, but with a fierce violence he runs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, and ſo is inſnared and taken: thirdly, The Melancholick Hatred is not naturall but accidental, for it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from an Aduſt, or burned Choler
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:122164:64"/>reſiding in the blood, but ſpecially in the Meſentery veines, who caſt ill and virulent vapors up to the brain that begets Chimaeraes, and ſtrange phanſies, that makes men ſometimes abhor their Parents, nay, their Wives and children: and this Melancholy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets ſuch a hatred in <hi>Timon</hi> the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> againſt mankinde,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</hi>
                  </note> that he cauſed Gibbets to be erected and ſet up in his Garden, and proclaimed through the ſtreets of the City, That whoſoever would come and hang themſelves, they might: fourthly, The Humane and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Hatred proceeds from an antipathy of Affections that is between ſome men; and between men and women, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary antipathy which was between the affections of <hi>Mark Antonius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Plutarch <hi>in</hi> Marcus Antonius <hi>Life.</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>Auguſtus Ceſar;</hi> for which <hi>Antonius</hi> was adviſed by an <hi>Aſtrologian,</hi> that the good Angel of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> would at laſt prevail over his; and the great antipathy there was between <hi>Socrates</hi> and his wife, who had lived one with another live Cats and Dogs, if the unparallel'd temperance of <hi>Socrates</hi> had not mitigated their debates. And it is ſeen daily, that men hate the company of ſome other men that never
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:122164:65"/>did them wrong, nor give them occaſion of offence: and I have known my ſelf a man and a woman of good means, that had ſuch an natural averſion one againſt the other, that they were inforced to live aſunder, and yet neither of them could ſhew a juſt cauſe; from whence this anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy of affections did proceed. There is another ſort of Humane Hatred that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, but the deſcription of it will be more proper in the next Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſome of the accidentall cauſes of the Hatred of men are theſe, for they are ſo numerous that I cannot ſpeak of them all: firſt, An inveterate wrath, is oftentimes the cauſe of an everlaſting Hatred, for when Wrath cannot vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it ſelf at the preſent, it becomes an incurable Hatred, becauſe Wrath is a ſuddain and fiery diſtemper of the Heart, which is but like a lightning if it may freely vent it ſelf; but if it be reſtrained in the breſt, it becomes an irreconcilable Hatred: It is a common ſaying, That Cholerick men never ſleep upon their anger, and that it is but a flaſh that paſſeth away; but if this Choler hath not ſome vent, it is changed into ſuch a hatred, that all the precepts of Philoſophy can hardly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:122164:65"/>extinguiſh the fire of it: ſecondly, One of the greateſt cauſes of Hatred is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of Love, or more properly of Luſt; the denial that <hi>Joſeph</hi> gave to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 39.17.20.</note> changed her love to a cruel hatred, for ſhe cauſed him to be caſt into a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and in ſtead of imbracements, to be fettered with irons: thirdly, Self-Love is an ordinary cauſe of Hatred; for ſuch as are poſſeſſed with this vanity, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves never ſufficiently reſpected nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored; and nothing doth ſooner engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Hatred in men then miſpriſion: fourthly, Calumnies and falſe Reports that blemiſh a mans Fame and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are cauſe of an inveterate Hatred, for Honor is dearer to ſome men then their own lives, and many have conſtantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured all other injuries, that have been caſt into great diſtempers by Calumnies, which have alſo bred ſuch a hatred in their hearts, that they have ſhunned all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with men,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Life.</note> as it may appear in <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molions</hi> Life: fifthly, The infidelity of men is often the cauſe of mens hatred; for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and Truſt abuſed, is a great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to Hatred: and the reaſon why Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is ſo predominant in theſe days, is, that men are ſo much addicted to betray
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:122164:66"/>the Truſt that others have confidently depoſed in their hands, for like Weather-Cocks they change their friendſhip upon the leſt occaſion of their friends diſgrace, nay Religion it ſelf, that ſhould be the greateſt link, and the ſtrongeſt bond to knit the fidelity of men together, is as ſubject to mutation and change as the Windes, for look as the current of the Times goes, theſe Camelions Religion is according to that which is moſt in faſhion: ſixthly, Jealouſies of Hate, and jealouſies of Love are great provokers to Hatred: The jealouſies that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Janiſaries did conceive,<note place="margin">See the <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Hiſtory in his Life.</note> that their Emperor <hi>Oſman</hi> would change his <hi>Militia,</hi> and remove the Seat of his Empire from <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> to <hi>Damaſco,</hi> begot ſuch an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable hatred in their hearts, that they cauſed him to be ſtrangled in the black Tower of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> The jealouſie that <hi>Mecaenas</hi> had conceived of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of his wife, did not onely deprive him of ſleep for three years together, but did alſo ingender ſuch a hatred in his heart againſt women, that he ever after abhorred the ſight of them: And that is the reaſon why the hatred pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the jealouſie of Love

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:122164:68"/>hath been the projector of all the horrid actions of men; for it is a paſſion that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives men of all Reaſon &amp; Judgment, and hath bin the cauſe of all the woes of men; for by the hatred of Satan, was our firſt mother <hi>Eve</hi>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:122164:69"/>ſave his life if he did it, but he had no ſooner by imprecations impiouſly denied him, but the other ſtabbed him through the heart with his Ponyard, ſaying, The death of thy body had not been an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject worthy of my hatred and vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except I had alſo procured the eternal death of thy ſoul: An horrid and unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd cruelty, and a matchleſs effect of hatred!</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Having thus deſcribed the evil nature and effects of Hatred; I will now come to the uſe that Chriſtians ſhould make of it. I remember to have ſaid in the beginning of this Chapter; that this paſſion of Hatred had not been given to men to abuſe it as they do, but rather to eſchew ſin, the greateſt evil upon earth, and that being uſed as an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to fly from ſin, it would ſerve for a ſtrong motive to the propagations of a godly life; for ſin ſhould be the onely object of mens hatred, as the efficient cauſe of all their miſeries; and why our bleſſed Saviour out of his tender compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions towards his Elect, was willing to ſuffer the ignominous death of the Croſs,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.35.</note> to redeem them from the guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſin which was eternal death;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:122164:70"/>And men cannot by any other means ſhew themſelves grateful, and to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this incompre henſible love of Chriſt, then by having an inveterate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt ſin, and to deteſt and abhor with all their hearts all ſinful courſes, ſith ſin is the onely ſeparation wall that bars them from having an intimate and loving familiarity with God: for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſin, is the firſt ſtep to attain to the love of God, and without the love of God, a true faith in Chriſt, and unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hatred of ſin, there is no poſſibility of ſalvation; hatred againſt ſin being the chiefeſt ingredient required in a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: and how can men love God that hate their brethren? and therefore the bleſſed Spirit in holy Writ, doth ſo often exhort men to avoid all hatred, except it be againſt ſin; <hi>He that</hi>

               <p>AS the billows of the Sea rowl one after another till they break themſelves into fome againſt the clifts or rocks of the adjacent ſhores; even ſo the deſires of men drive away one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other till they vaniſh away into the ſmok, becauſe the objects of their deſires are for the greater part but vanity; for not one man of a thouſand doth fix his deſires upon the right object, that can ſatisfie his deſires, and fill his heart with joy and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:122164:71"/>content; and although mens deſires be as free as their thoughts; for the greateſt Tyrants have no power over them, yet there is an Eagle eye above, who ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the reins, that knows their deſires as well as their thoughts. Men ſhould therefore be very cautious in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, ſith they proceed from the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcible appetite, and are properly called Cupidity, and in plain Engliſh Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; and how dangerous it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire or covet any thing prohibited in the Law of God, I leave it to the judgment of the Reader; ſith in the Interpretation of our bleſſed Saviour, who was the beſt Interpretor of the Law that ever was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, <hi>He that coveteth a woman to luſt after her, hath already committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with her.</hi> If evil deſires then be ſo cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, men ſhould be very wary how they fix their deſires, for they have a hand in all their paſſions,<note place="margin">

               <p>Thirdly, The proprieties and effects of mens deſires change according to the good and evil nature of their objects, and of their moderation, or diſtemper; for the neceſſary deſires of men, who are for the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:122164:73"/>greater part harmleſs and innocent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vicious if they be violent and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, which makes mens condition to be worſe then that of the unreaſonable creatures, for they have alſo natural and neceſſary deſires, or rather natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations as well as men, but they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in the greateſt part; for the Oxen,<note place="margin">The propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſires.</note> Horſes, and Sheep have a natural and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary deſire to their food; but when they have graſed ſufficiently to ſatisfie their hunger, they lye down and reſt themſelves, bounding their deſires with that meaſure and quantity of food as doth ſatisfie Nature: but men whom God hath indued with Reaſon, whereby they might better then they, moderate their deſires, give them neither bounds nor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, many of them eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more then will ſuffice Nature, and by their exorbitant diſtemper, are oftentimes inforced (to eaſe Nature) to vomit up what they have eaten and drunk: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the brute creatures are ſatisfied with the clothing that Nature hath beſtowed on them; the beaſt of the field with their Wooll or Hair, and the fowls of the air with their Feathers, but men are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with their natural skins, nor with

The next propriety of mens deſires is their Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, being rather guided by Fanſie, then by Reaſon, for they deſire commonly ſuch things as are moſt oppoſite, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their own good, and the welfare of their ſouls and bodies; for in their diet they love and deſire to eat of ſuch things as are moſt contrary to the preſervation of their health; &amp; in their actions they deſire, and take more delight in thoſe which are more oppoſite to the ſalvation of their ſouls, their deſires being more violent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the pleaſures of the fleſh, then zealous or fervent after the ways of a godly life; ſo that mens deſires and inclinations are ever more addicted, and fixed upon the evill then upon the good, except the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and propriety of them be changed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:122164:76"/>by divine Grace.<note place="margin">The effects of mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</note> As for the effects of mens deſires, they are, as I have ſaid before, Good of Evil, according to their objects; but ſith it hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that they are commonly fixed upon evil objects, their effects muſt of neceſſity be rather evil then good: If the honors of this world be their object, the fruits and effects of Adhbition is the deſolation of Kingdoms, the ſhedding of innocent blood, and the miſeries that follow civil and inteſtine wars: If their object be the riches of this world, their effects are carking cares, moiling and toyling, and vexation of minde in their acquiſition, and fears and apprehenſions in their keeping, and grief and ſorrow in the loſing of them. If the pleaſures of this world be their object, the effects wil be the waſting of their means, the impairing of their health, and the indangering of their ſouls. But if the object of their deſires be the glory of God, then their effects will be comfort in this life, and eternal bliſs in the life to come;<note place="margin">The fruition of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, is the onely object that can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of men.</note> So that upon the good or bad election of the objects of mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, depends their happineſs or woe in this life, and their torment or glory in the life to come: It behoveth men therefore
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:122164:76"/>to be wary upon what objects they fix their deſires, ſith there is not any thing under the Sun that can ſatisfy them; for if all the excellency of the creatures were abſtracted into one, yet it could not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the deſires of men, ſich their ſoul is a ſpark of the divine eſſence that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be free of the anxiety and perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of minde, that proceed from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, and reſtleſneſs of mens deſires, till by grace it doth injoy the ſight of the glorious preſence of God, the original Spring of it, who is the fulneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all bliſs, for that object onely can ſatisfy the wiſhes and deſires of their ſouls.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The comforts that Chriſtians may receive in this life of their godly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are many, as it ſhall appear when I have perſwaded them to indevor to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh from their minde the ſwarms of vain deſires, that diſquiet the tranquillity of their ſouls, which may be done by theſe means: firſt, To hate and abhor all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſires, for as long as they have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy in their ſouls, it is impoſſible for them to have a feeling of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts proceeding from the ſpiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: for the fleſh having the maſtery

The third means is to purifie their hearts; for as clean and pure ſtreams cannot proceed from a foul and muddy Spring, even ſo it is impoſſible that godly deſires ſhould ſpring from the hearts of men except they be purified and ſanctified by the Spirit of God; for as our bleſſed Saviour ſaith,<note n="b" place="margin">Matth 15.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications,</hi> &amp;c. and theſe are the effects of mens deſires, whoſe hearts are not purified by grace,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:122164:77"/>becauſe the Concupiſcible appetite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in the heart; and this appetite is the ſpring or root of all the deſires of men. The fourth means is for men to ſet a watchful Centry over their eyes; for by the eye men perceive the objects, and the objects are the moving cauſe of mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Cupidities: by the eye King <hi>David</hi> ſaw the beauty of<note n="c" place="margin">2 Sam. 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 2.</note>

                  <hi>With my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night, yea, with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early:</hi> fifthly, A certain aſſurance that their deſires ſhall be granted, ſith they have baniſhed their former vain, and extravagant deſires, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,<note n="i" place="margin">Pro. 10.24.</note>

               <p>GOd out of his infinite love to men, hath been pleaſed to furniſh them with arms to oppoſe their greateſt enemies, of which the paſſion of Cupidity is one of the moſt implacable; for of all the paſſions it is the harder to be ſubdued, becauſe it is the moſt ſucceſsful ſnare of Satan for the increaſe of his kingdom of darkneſs; by it ſin came firſt into the world, and hath infected like a contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſeaſe all the race of mankinde; For by the eye, which is the ſpring of mens deſires, <hi>Eve</hi> ſeeing the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledg of good and evil to be beautiful, ſhe coveteth the ſame, as it appears by theſe words;<note place="margin">Gen. 3.6.</note>

Now againſt this great enemy of mankinde, God hath been pleaſed to arm them with this paſſion of Flight, the great Antagoniſt of all covetous deſires; that as he had given men an inclination to deſire ſuch things as ſeemed good to their eyes and phanſies, they might alſo have an averſion to fly from ſuch things as ſeemed to traverſe their good and beeing, otherwiſe they might have ſeen their enemies coming upon them, when they had no arms to defend themſelves, nor power to eſchew or fly from their apparent danger, and had been inforced to cheriſh vices, and ſinful courſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could not eſchew, or fly from them, and to harbor a Gueſt whom they abhorred and deteſted.

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The objects of Flight.</note> The chiefeſt objects of this paſſion, are the guilt and puniſhment, which are often taken one for the other; ſome men taking the guilt for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the puniſhment for the guilt; but guilt is the greater of the two, becauſe the puniſhment is but an effect of the guilt, and without guilt there would be no puniſhment; and yet becauſe death is commonly comprized under the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (for as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom 6.23.</note> 
                  <hi>The wages of ſin is death</hi>) men moſt commonly ſtrive to avoid and flee from the puniſhment, and with great eagerneſs purſue the guilt: I mean, they run chearfully after ſin, and fly with fear from the puniſhment, and ſo pervert the uſe of this paſſion that was given unto them by their Maker, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to flee from ſin, that draws with Cart-ropes the wrath and judgments of God upon all Nations, and particuliar men that impenitently go on in their ſins. Men commonly fly from Serpents, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, Lyons and Tygers, and from the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:122164:80"/>contagious diſeaſe of the Plague, but they ſeldom flee from ſin, although it be more dangerous and deſtructive to their ſouls, then any of theſe things above related can be to their bodies, for they can but deprive them of this temporal life, but ſin, without the ſpecial grace of God, will caſt them body and ſoul into the everlaſting flames: and therefore let men fly from ſin if they intend to make a perfect uſe of this paſſion, and let them not (as our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour ſaith of Fear) <hi>Flee from them that can kill the body,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 10.28.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The cauſes of Flight are ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,<note place="margin">The cauſes of Flight.</note> that they would be over-tedious to relate, I wil therefore ſpeak but of ſome of them: firſt, Men if they could, would fly from death, becauſe death is a moſt horrid thing, ſpecially to the Reprobate; and Nature doth hate and eſchew all things that may annihilate its beeing: ſecondly, Fear is an ordinary cauſe of Flight, for many great Armies have fled upon a panick fear, as <hi>Titus Livius</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords in his Decades: but there be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances for it in the holy Scriptures, as it appears, 2 <hi>Kings, Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>When

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:122164:82"/>out, with a long abſence, and it is daily ſeen, that the laſt object of a beauty drives out of mens mindes the former impreſſions of another beauty: and daily experience doth ſhew, that to appeaſe wrath, the onely remedy is to flee from, or to eſchew the preſence of him that is tranſported with that paſſion, for the cauſe being taken away the effects ceaſe; ſo the object being removed, which did cauſe the diſtemper in the ſoul, the paſſion by degrees doth vaniſh away.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The proprieties of Flight are as numerous as the cauſes of it, and there is as great a ſimilitude between Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and Flight,<note place="margin">The propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of Flight.</note> as there is between Love and Deſire: firſt, it ſeemeth to fly from evil, and doth aim at the good: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Flight in outward appearance ſeems to be a coward, and yet it is as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous as the Deſire; for to fly from ſin is a greater valour then to fight in the field with a valiant enemy: Sith it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, that he that hath the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery over his own paſſions, and can mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the cupidities of his deſires, is a greater conquerer then <hi>Ceſar:</hi> thirdly, As the Deſire calls Hope to its aid when it cannot obtain that which is difficult,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:122164:82"/>ſo Flight calls to its aid Fear and Hatred, that it may with ſwifter wings fly from the evil that is overpowerful: fourthly, As the deſire is a ſign of indigence, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and want, ſo Flight is an evidence of Impatiency and Imbecillity; and as men obtain by the proſecution of their deſires, ſuch things as they want, ſo men by flight free themſelves of thoſe things they moſt abhor and deteſt: fifthly, The propriety of Deſire is to open and dilate the heart, to make the ſame more eager after the proſecution of the good it aims at; ſo Flight ſhrinks up the heart, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bars ſin from coming in to it: ſixthly, As men by the means of the Deſire injoy and poſſeſs the good, even ſo men by the help of Flight preſerve themſelves from evil. In a word,<note place="margin">Deſire and Flight are the two Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of Love and Hatred.</note> Deſire and Flight are the two faithful Champions of Love and Hatred; for as Love cannot execute any generous achievement without the aid of the Deſire, ſo Hatred cannot perform any noble exploit, without the help of Flight.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the effects of Flight,<note place="margin">The effects of Flight.</note> tend ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the preſervation of the body, or of the ſoul; I will then firſt ſpeak of that of the body, and acquaint you, that all
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:122164:83"/>horrid and terrible things that may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the annihilation of mens beeing, or deprive them from the good they aim at, inticeth this paſſion, either to eſchew or fly from them.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 18.11. and 19.10.</note> It moved <hi>David</hi> to avoid the Javelin that <hi>Saul</hi> threw at him, with an intent to ſmite him even to the wall, but <hi>David</hi> fled and eſcaped: again, when he was informed by <hi>Jonathan,</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> his father did ſeek after his life, then he fled again to <hi>Nob,</hi> to <hi>Ahimelech</hi> the Prieſt; and divers other times when he was in danger, he fled from the preſence of <hi>Saul</hi> and all to preſerve his life. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> being at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and hearing that the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſet wait for his life, and. watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the gates day and night to kill him,<note place="margin">Act. 9.23, 24</note> 
                  <hi>the diſciples took him by night and let him down by the wall in a basket,</hi> preſerving his life by his flight. It appears then by theſe two Inſtances, that the effects of Flight tend ſpecially to the preſervation of mens beeing; and when they fly from ſin, to the prevention of the danger of their ſouls: for they have no better remedy, as it hath been ſaid already, to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from luſt, and from all laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious deſires, then to flee from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that engender the ſame. But why
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:122164:83"/>they fly ſooner from the puniſhment of evil, then from the guilt of ſin, I will hear enlarge my ſelf, and intreat the Reader to take notice, that it is onely the natural men, that do ſo much abhor the puniſhment,<note place="margin">Why men fly from the puniſhment, rather then from the guilt of ſin.</note> and are ſo eager to preſerve the guilt, for the true children of God do more deteſt the guilt then the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for they know the puniſhment of ſin is as inſeparable from the guilt, as the ſhadow is from the body, and they fear more to offend their gracious God, then the puniſhment of ſin: but the wicked who have their portion in this life are afraid of the puniſhment more then of the guilt, becauſe their ſupream good is in this life, which puniſhment ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt; but the children of God carry their Croſs, and have nothing but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces, trouble, and vexations in this life, and expect their ſupream bliſs and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will be in the world to come, and are confident and aſſured, that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and puniſhments, that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts upon them becauſe of their ſins, are but ſo many evidences that their heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father doth love, and hath a care of them, and ſo do adore the arm, and kiſſe the hand of God that is pleaſed to chaſtiſe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:122164:84"/>them, <hi>For whom the Lord loveth,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.6.</note> 
                  <hi>he chaſteneth and ſcourgeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſon whom he receiveth;</hi> but the wicked murmur at the leaſt corrections they receive from the hand of God, and ſay with the two men that were poſſeſſed with evil ſpirits,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.29.</note> 
                  <hi>What have we to do with thee? art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> for ſo they injoy the pleaſures of this life, they care not what will become of them in the world to come, being of this minde, <hi>That one bird in the hand is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then two in the buſh.</hi> But to return from whence this digreſſion brought me: one of the chiefeſt effects of Flight, is, that it is the protector of Womens and Virgins Chaſtity, and makes yong men free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from vitious and debauſht compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which they are to flee from, as from a contagious Air, or from the ſight of a Serpent, for ill company are Satans Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the corrupters of youth, and as men cannot handle Pitch without ſoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hands, ſo young folk cannot haunt ill company without they blemiſh their reputation, and defile their maners, nor remain in their innocency, for they are the Schools of Sin, and ſin draws the wrath of God upon men, from whoſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:122164:84"/>wrath it is impoſſible to flee, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whether ſhall I go from thy Spirit?</hi>

               <p>Sixthly, The uſe that men ſhould make of this paſſion of Flight, ſhould be to flee from all appearance of evil, as well as from ſin, and not transfer their own ſins upon others as <hi>Adam</hi> did upon <hi>Eve, The woman,</hi> ſaith he to the Lord,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.12.</note> 
                  <hi>whom thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the Tree, and I did eat.</hi> Much leſs to charge and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe men of ſins, of which they are moſt guilty themſelves, for this kinde of ſin is altogether in faſhion in theſe days; neither muſt men make conſcience of one
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:122164:85"/>ſin, and make none of another; ſome will make ſcruple to ſwear, but they will make no account to lye a hundred times in a day, ſo they may with theſe lyes delude their brethren, and attain to their own ends. Others will forbear to eat Fiſh upon a Friday, but will make no account of drabbing and whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; others will flee from one ſin, and will run eagerly after another. In a word, there never was an age more addicted to painting then this, for the moſt notorious ſins are ſo varniſhed and painted over, that men take Vices for Vertues: And that is the reaſon why I ſaid in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Chapter, that men ſhould be cautious how they make uſe of this paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for fear they flee from the good in lieu to eſchew the evil, or get an habit of averſion againſt the good, in ſtead to have it againſt the evil: but if this paſſion of Flight be applied againſt its right ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it will prove to be of great efficacy to the propagation of a godly life, for it is impoſſible to love and affect the good unfainedly, before men have obtained a ſtrong averſion againſt the evil; and therefore to attain to that bleſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:122164:85"/>in the firſt <hi>Pſalm,</hi> they muſt flee from all maner of converſation with the wicked, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that walketh not in the counſel of the ungodly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 1.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>nor ſtandeth in the way of ſinners, nor ſitteth in the ſeat of the ſcornful, but his delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth he meditate day and night.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 4.18.</note> And <hi>Salomon</hi> ſecondeth him thus; <hi>Enter not in the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men, avoid it, and paſs not by it, turn from it and paſs away;</hi> This triple gradation of <hi>Salomon</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with a great Emphaſie, how neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it is for men to flee from the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wicked men, and from all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſin; and yet there are too many that add ſin to ſin, and ſo fall under this cenſure of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>

               <p>AS Laughter is an expreſſion of Joy, ſo Weeping is an evidence of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; but theſe two proprieties, are onely peculiar to mankinde: becauſe the Ape that ſeemeth to laugh, doth but grin; and the Crocodile that ſeemeth to weep, doth but mone: for Joy and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row are affections of the minde, and therefore the unreaſonable creatures are incapable of them: Notwithſtanding, ſome Moraliſts conceive, that the paſſion of Joy, and the paſſion of Delight, which the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Delectation,</hi> is but one and the ſame paſſion, which cannot certainly be: becauſe Delight is common to men and beaſt, ſo is not Joy, for Delight pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the pleaſures of the Senſes, and Joy from the contentedneſs of the minde; and our bleſſed Saviour while he was upon earth, ſhewed that theſe affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions did reſide in him, as it may appear by theſe words,<note place="margin">Joh. 15.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you,

                  <hi>When Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus therefore ſaw her weeping, and the</hi> Jews <hi>alſo weeping which came with her, he groaned in the Spirit, and was troubled, and ſaid, Where have ye laid him?

               <p>Firſt, There are two different ſorts of Joy, the one is Worldly, and the other Spiritual; the laſt is a rapture or raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul, by an intimate familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that true Chriſtians have with their gracious God, by contemplation, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or fervent prayers: The firſt is a ſudden and violent motion of the heart, that cauſeth a great alteration in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,<note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Joy. See <hi>Theu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt. Boju.</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaties upon <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle Phyſ. fol.</hi> 727.</note> proceeding in the opinion of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts from the poſſeſſion or fight of ſome object much deſired; which is really good, or reputed to be ſo by the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of men; yet it will appear by the proprieties and effects of it, that it doth not always come from the poſſeſſion or injoyment of a beloved object, or from an imaginary good, but ſometimes from relations, ſcurrilous ſpeeches, ridiculous
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:122164:87"/>poſtures, and deformedobjects: for Joy is, as I have ſaid before, an affection of the minde, and is rather infuſed in the Heart, by the Eye, and by the Ear, then by any of the other three Senſes; for thoſe are more proper to the paſſion of Volupty, of which Delight or Delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a branch; however it is the fifth paſſion incident to the Concupiſcible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and proceeds from divers cauſes, as it will appear in the next Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The cauſes of worldly joy, are either Publick or Private: the Publick proceed commonly from the immediate hand of God, or from his favor, or by his permiſſion, and of theſe I ſhall ſpeak in the firſt place: firſt, It was a great cauſe of publick joy, proceeding from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand of God to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> preſently after their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to ſee the ſea go back,<note place="margin">Exod. 14.21. to 31.</note> and make a free paſſage for their hoſt, to paſs through the midſt of it, and when they were all ſafe come to dry land, to ſee the rowling waves of the ſea to turn back and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm <hi>Pharoah</hi> and all his Army: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It was a cauſe of publick Joy, when it pleaſed the Lord to deliver the people of the <hi>Iews,</hi> from that bloody

                  </note> It was an incredible cauſe of publick joy for <hi>England,</hi> when the Lord was pleaſed to deliver this Nation from the devilliſh plot of the Gunpouder Treaſon, for which miraculous delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, after hearty thanks given to God, great Feaſting, Bond-fires, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of joy were made in <hi>London,</hi> and through the whole Land.</p>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:122164:89"/>at the fourty ſixt <hi>Verſe</hi> of the firſt <hi>Chap.</hi> of St. <hi>Luke.</hi> Here was a true and real Cauſe of Spiritual Joy, not onely for the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> but alſo for all the Elected of God, who by free grace have part in the merits of Chriſt; By theſe Inſtances it appears, that theſe cauſes of joy did proceed from the ſeeing and hearing, which are the two Senſes moſt proper to the paſſion of Joy. There are divers other Cauſes of worldly joy, which are not ſo well grounded as theſe, but are moſt vain and ridiculous, and they are theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>The joy of private and worldly men ſuits with their inclinations: firſt, The Ambitious will rejoyce in the increaſe of their honors: ſecondly, The Covetous men in the abundance of their riches: thirdly,<note place="margin">The cauſes of private mens joy.</note> The Voluptuous men will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the injoyment of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: fourthly, The Merchants and Tradeſ-men in the increaſe of their Trade: fifthly, The Lawyers in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of their Clients, and in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of their neighbors: ſixthly, The prophane and Libertine in all manner of ridiculous Sports, ſcurrilous Songs, lewd Muſick; Dancing, Valting, and in laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:122164:89"/>Pictures, and Poſtures, and in Chambering, Gluttony and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and theſe are the common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary cauſes of the joy of worldly men, Let the Reader judg then, whether car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal joy be not meer vanity, and vexation of Spirit: for the great vanity of it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Solomon</hi> to ſay, <hi>I ſaid of laughter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 2.2.</note> 
                  <hi>it is mad, and of mirth, what doth it?</hi> and the very truth is, that men tranſported with immoderate joy, are like fools and mad men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The proprieties of worldly joy are theſe: firſt, Worldly joy is of hot temper: ſecondly, It is of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative or ſpreading quality; and theſe two proprieties are the cauſe that ſudden joy doth bereave men of life; for when ſome beloved object, or glad tidings are unexpectedly repreſented to the eyes, or ears of men, this cauſeth a violent altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all the parts of the body, but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the heart, by means of the hot, and dilative quality of this paſſion of Joy, becauſe the blood and the vital ſpirits that reſide in it, are with great violence driven from the inward parts to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the members of the body,<note place="margin">The propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of worldly joy.</note> whereby mens hearts are deprived of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:122164:90"/>their natural heat, and of their vital ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and ſo fall into a ſwoon; or if this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be over-fierce and violent, it doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh their life, as the ſnuff of a Candle goeth out when it hath no more tallow to ſuſtain its light: Now the heart who is the efficient cauſe of life, being thus deprived of heat, loſeth its motion, upon which depends the life of men; for the beating of the heart gives life and motion to all the members of the body, and is congealed and frozen to death by this ſudden motion and privation, as water is congealed into Ice by a great froſt: and this may be confirmed by another violent action of men, of which many are yet living that were eye-witneſſes to it; Two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Foot-men running a race for a great wager from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Kingſton,</hi> did by their ſwift and violent running, ſo drive their blood and vital ſpirits from the heart to the extreameſt parts of their bodies, that their faces looked as black as their hats; one of them obtained the victory, and out-ran the other about twenty yards, and being joyful of his gain and honor preſumed over-much of his ſtrength, and did not uſe the means to preſerve himſelf (as the other did, who
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:122164:90"/>was much more diſtempered then he) whereby his blood and vital ſpirits, in ſtead of returning to the heart, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed in the extream parts of his body by taking cold: which did deprive him of life within few hours after: but the other putting on his apparel, and covering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a warm cloak, prayed two of his fellows to walk him up and down till his blood and vital ſpirits were ſetled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain about his heart,<note place="margin">A remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Relation.</note> and by this means he was as well the next morning as ever he was before; now the motion of the blood being more violent by the inward diſtemper of the fiery paſſion of Joy, then it can be by the motion of a long-continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed race, it muſt by conſequence be more dangerous and mortal then the other: thirdly, As the immoderate Joy hath dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous proprieties, the moderate joy hath many good, for moderate joy preſerves and increaſeth the health of the body: fourthly, It giveth a ſeemly and loving aſpect, and a freſh colour to the face: fifthly, It makes mens company and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation more pleaſant and acceptable to all other men: ſixthly, It makes men more chearful in their particular and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral calling, and paſs their days through
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:122164:91"/>this vale of Tears with more alacrity and content.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The effects of immoderate Joy would be incredible,<note place="margin">The effects of immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate joy. See <hi>Livius</hi> in his third Decade, <hi>li.</hi> 3.</note> if they had not been recorded by approved and faithful Authors: firſt, A <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, ſaith <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> died with joy at the ſight of her ſon, whom ſhe conceived to have been ſlain at the battell of <hi>Cannae:</hi> ſecondly, The Author of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Hiſtory Records,<note place="margin">See the <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Hiſtory in the life of <hi>Achmath.</hi>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:122164:91"/>Galley, and with an honorable train to his father <hi>Sinna,</hi> that had lately been made grand Viſier by <hi>Achmath,</hi> Emperor of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who was then at <hi>Caffa</hi> upon the black ſea; but this yong man was no ſooner come into his ſight, but <hi>Sinna</hi> tranſported with joy fell dead at his ſons feet; whereby it appears that he who had the power to bear with admirable conſtancy, the tidings of the death of his onely ſon, had not the power to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the joy that he did receive by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected return: thirdly, <hi>Theophraſtus Boujou,</hi> records the names, and means of a dozen more at leaſt, who have died ſuddenly by the violent diſtemper of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate joy, ſome by honors received, others for ſeeing their mortal enemy ly wallowing in his own blood,<note place="margin">See <hi>Boujou</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ariſtotle, lib.</hi> 19. <hi>ca.</hi> 39. <hi>fol.</hi> 835.</note> ready to give up the Ghoſt; and others by looking upon Pictures, which by their ugly fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures inforced them to ſuch an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate laughter as it did deprive them of life; others for being victorious in the <hi>Olympian</hi> Sports; and others in the field, as it is recorded of <hi>Epamonides,</hi> and of the Duke of <hi>Roan,</hi> who died rather for joy of two great victories obtained againſt their enemies in two pitcht battels, then by their wounds.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:122164:92"/>
               <p>Fifthly, The bad and good uſe of this paſſion of Joy, doth onely conſiſt in the not regulating, or in the regulating of it; for if Joy be let in to the ſoul by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the ſting and venom of it is changed into an Antidote, and doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfort Nature then deſtroy it; for as it is dangerous to open the Floud-gates of a river ſuddenly,<note place="margin">The bad and good uſe of worldly joy.</note> and all at once, for fear the violence of the water break down the banks, and pull up the foundation of the ſluce, even ſo it is dangerous to let in, into the ſoul all at once, the ſwift cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of good or evil tidings; therefore if <hi>Cicala Baſha</hi> had only at the firſt ſent word to the Viſier <hi>Sinna,</hi> that he had happily reſcued his ſon, and that as ſoon as his wounds ſhould be cured, he would ſend him back unto him in an honorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, this had undoubtedly prevented the death of this old man; but the ſudden and unexpected ſight of his ſon, whom he thought to have been dead, cauſed ſo violent a perturbation in his minde, and ſo great an alteration in the vital faculties of his body, that his natural ſtrength, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in his declining age, was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with it, and his life utterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, as the light of a candle is by a
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:122164:92"/>violent blaſt of winde: But the Duke of <hi>Medina Coeli,</hi> who was General for <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Hiſtory in <hi>Philip</hi> the ſeconds life.</note> of the invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Armado</hi> (as they termed it) that came againſt <hi>England,</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi> 1588. did deal more prudently with his Prince, for his ſhip being the firſt that arrived into <hi>Spain,</hi> after the utter rout of this great Navy, he ſent a diſcreet Meſſenger unto him, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him that ſome part of his Navy had miſcarried by foul weather, and that himſelf had been driven back by a ſtorm; and eight days after he ſent another meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to the King, informing him of the particulars, and ſome days after came in perſon to give him an account of his Journey, whereby he did prevent the evil effects, that ſuch a loſs might have cauſed by a ſudden impreſſion in his Princes heart: therefore the mitigation of the violence of the paſſions of Joy and Sorrow is of great uſe, whereas if they be not moderated, they are dangerous and deſtructive: It may then be collected by theſe diſcourſes, that worldly joy is but meer vanity and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit, for as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>The trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing of the wicked is ſhort,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Spiritual Joy doth as much excel
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:122164:93"/>the worldly Joy, as the Light doth Darkneſs, it raviſheth the ſoul, and fills it with unſpeakable pleaſures; the nature of it is incomprehenſible; neither can the ſuperlative excellency of it be expreſſed nor deſcribed by the Tongue nor Pen of men, for our bleſſed Saviour himſelf, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the vanity of the paſsion of Dolour, or Sorrow.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SOme Moraliſts are of opinion, that <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocency was free from this paſſion of Dolour, and that it was after his Fall inflicted upon him as a puniſhment for his diſobedience againſt his Maker; becauſe this paſſion is ſo common to men, that it followeth them at the heeles, as the Spaniel doth his Maſter, their lives being but a continual ſucceſſion of anguiſh, grief, and ſorrow, from their very Cradle to their Grave: Which unparallel'd miſery could not conſiſt, ſay they, with that bleſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which man was created at the firſt: yet I rather conceive, that all the paſſions that are at this preſent incident to men, were in our firſt father in the time of his innocency; and that God was pleaſed then to give him the power and ability to keep them obedient and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to his Will and Reaſon, which power was taken away from him for his apoſtacy and preſumptuous rebellion
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:122164:95"/>againſt the ſpecial charge and<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 3.6, 7.</note> command given unto him by his Creator; and was not onely deprived of this power, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of that royal Prerogative that God had given him over the beaſts of the Field, the fowls of the Air, and the fiſhes of the Sea; ſo that ever ſince his Fall, his ſeed hath had enemies within, and without, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and correct them, for the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their firſt Parents, and their own actual ſins, againſt their gratious God, who had created all things perfectly<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 1.25.</note> 
                  <hi>good,</hi> and ſubmitted the moſt fierce and cruel beaſts of the Field, the devouring fowls of the Air, and the monſters of the Sea to be ſubject and ſubordinate to the will of man: But he having firſt of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt his Maker, his own paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the bruit creatures by the juſt judgment of God have alſo<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 3.18.</note> ſhaken off the obedience and reſpect they did ow unto him: yet the unreaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are his meaneſt enemies, for by that ſmall ſpark of knowledg and divine Power and Majeſty that is left in him, he doth daily finde out means to curb their fury and rage, but wants power and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to regulate the exorbitant diſtemper of his own paſſions, of all which Dolour
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:122164:95"/>is one of the moſt irkſome. Now for the better deſcription of it, I will ſpeak of theſe particulars in order.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of the definition of Dolour.</item>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt, The Moraliſts are of different opinions, concerning the definition of this paſſion of Dolour, under which is compriſed, Anguiſh, Grief, and Sorrow, ſome ſay it is a paſſion of the ſoul, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from ſome ſenſible loſs or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure received; others ſay, it is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of the minde, and an anguiſh of the body; others, that it is a paſſion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting the ſoul, by the apprehenſion of preſent and future evils: but this laſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſeemeth to be the beſt.<note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Biſhop of <hi>Marſeillis, pag</hi> 302.</note> 
                  <hi>Dolour is a paſsion of the ſoul, proceeding from the diſlike that men receive from the objects repreſented to their imagination by their Senſes, which are averſe, to their inclinations, and irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to their bodies.</hi> Moreover, It is the laſt paſſion incident to the Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcible
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:122164:96"/>appetite, and the root of divers other paſſions, and the great Antagoniſt of worldly Joy, becauſe all carnal Joy doth end in Sorrow; there being none ſo pure, but it leaves in the ſoul a ſting of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe and repentance: but Spiritual Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is one of the greateſt motives that men have to induce them to beate with fervency the ways of righteouſneſs, <hi>For godly ſorrow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.10.</note> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, worketh Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to ſalvation not to be repented of, but the ſorrow of the world worketh death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, There are divers ſorts and degrees of Dolour, for the very word of Dolour doth ſignify Anguiſh, Grief, and Sorrow, and every one of theſe have their degrees: Anguiſh doth properly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Dolours, Pains, and Torments of the Body, whether they be natural or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental: and Grief doth ſignify the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Minde; and Sorrow is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetered grief of the Minde, which is by long continuance turned into an habit of Sorrow: The firſt of theſe which is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, hath a ſecret reflection to the Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive appetite of the ſoul, by means of the communion there is between it and the ſenſes; yet the ſeat of Anguiſh is in the body: or in ſome of the members of

                  <note place="margin">Job 1.21.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 26.6.</note> fifthly, The loſs of Parents, Wife, Children, or intimate Friends, is often times the cauſe of mens ſorrow; for want of the rememoration of this ſaying of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.20.</note> 
                  <hi>All are of the duſt, and all ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to duſt again:</hi> ſixthly, the vain appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions that man have of the evil to come, is the cauſe of their ſorrow, becauſe they rely not upon this gracious promiſe, <hi>All things work together for good to them that love God:</hi> ſeventhly,<note place="margin">Rom 8.28.</note> The want of courage in men is the cauſe of their ſorrow, becauſe like faint hearted Pilots, they give over
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:122164:99"/>the Helme of the Ship in a ſtorm; I mean, the Helme of their Reaſon, whereby they might regulate the diſtempers of this paſſion of Sorrow: eightly, The fears that poſſeſs men for the puniſhment of their ſins, is a cauſe of their ſorrow; whereas they ſhould fear and grieve for the guilt of ſin, to attain to that ſpiritual Sorrow, which worketh repentance to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The Natural cauſes of the Dolour and Anguiſh of the body may be theſe: firſt, Long and tedious diſeaſes,<note place="margin">The natural cauſes of the Dolour and Anguiſh of the body.</note> as the Stone in the Kidneys or Bladder, the Gravel, the Strangullion, the Gout, the Cough, and conſumption of the Lungs, or the Hectick Feaver; for all theſe in continuance of time by the ſecret communion that the ſenſes have with the ſenſitive power of the ſoul, do beget in the minde grief and ſorrow; beſides the Dolour and Anguiſh of the body: ſecondly, The Aduſt or burnt Choler or Bilis gathered in the Meſentery veines, which ſendeth virulent vapors up into the braine, is a natural cauſe of much ſorrow.</p>
               <p n="4">4.<note place="margin">The acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental cauſes of ſorrow.</note> The accidentall cauſes may be theſe: firſt when men themſelves, or their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Children, or intimate Friends do
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:122164:99"/>accidentally come to their end, by ſea or by land, as to be murdered upon a Rode, or caſt away at ſea, or taken captive by Pyrats, or ſlain by a fall from a horſe, or lamed by ſome other accident; all theſe things are cauſes of ſorrow and grief: yet none of theſe natural, or accidental cauſes are or ſhould be ſufficient to breed ſorrow to mens minde, ſith nothing happens caſually or accidentally, but is guided by the hand of the divine Providence, to whoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed will men are obliged to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and our bleſſed Saviour doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us, that the meaneſt Sparrow, or an hair of our head, doth not fall to the <hi>ground</hi> without the permiſſion of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The nature and effects of Sorrow, are directly contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and to the effects of Joy: firſt, The nature of Joy, is to dilate and ſpread the blood, and the vital ſpirits that reſide in it into the utmoſt parts of the members of the body; but Sorrow being of a cold and dry nature, draws the blood and vital ſpirits from the utmoſt parts of the body towards the heart to comfort the ſame: ſecondly, Joy is hot and active, and by
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:122164:100"/>its ſudden motion indangers the life of men;<note place="margin">The natur and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, Grief, and Sorrow.</note> but Sorrow is cold and ſlow, and comes upon men with leaden feet; and never cauſeth death, but by long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and lingering diſeaſes, except it caſt men into deſpair, as it doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as it will be ſhown in the effects of it: thirdly, Joy is proper and pleaſant to Nature, and rejoyceth the heart, and makes men chearful in their Calling, both private and general, but Sorrow is adverſe and diſtaſteful to Nature, and makes men ſlow and ſtupid in their particular and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral calling: fourthly, Joy preſerveth and increaſeth health, and lengtheneth mens days, and makes them paſs their lives with mirth and content; but Sorrow im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs mens health, and ſhortens their days, and makes their lives to be tedious and irkſome: In a word, moderate Joy is comfort to man, and exceſſive Sorrow is the bane of man. And the effects of worldly Sorrow are as bad or rather worſe: firſt, Sorrow makes men flee the ſociety of men, nay the very light of the Sun, and all things that may rejoyce and comfort Nature, the ſight of their deareſt friends, nay, of their wife and children is irkſome to men that are poſſeſſed with
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:122164:100"/>exceſſive ſorrow: ſecondly,<note place="margin">See the Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or Book of Martyrs.</note> If mens Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row proceeds from mens Apoſtacy in Religion, it doth commonly caſt them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſpaire, and inflicts upon them in this life the very paines of hell, as it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the life of <hi>Franciſco Spira:</hi> thirdly, Sorrow tempts carnal men to be rid of it, to deſperate reſolutions, as to bereave themſelves of life, by hanging, ſtabbing, and drowning of themſelves, as it hath lately been ſeen in this City of <hi>London:</hi> fourthly, Sorrow makes men careleſs to make their calling and election ſure, and to neglect the means appointed by God for their ſalvation, I mean, the hearing of the Word, with that attention as they ſhould; for their thoughts and cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo fixed, upon the object of their ſorrow, that they minde nothing elſe; for this pernicious paſſion doth ſtupifie the moſt noble faculty of the ſoul, as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, the Imagination, and the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Divers other effects might be produced, but theſe will ſuffice to induce men to indeavor to eſchew, or regulate this dangerous and deſtructive paſsion.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Remedies againſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom of this paſsion are, firſt, Natural; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Moral; thirdly, Spiritual. The
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:122164:101"/>Natural are, firſt, to flee as far as men can from the object of their ſorrow: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, If mens ſorrow proceeds from Natural infirmities; they are in the firſt place to call upon God; and then uſe the Counſel of Phyſitians, for they muſt not do as <hi>Ahaziah</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did,<note place="margin">2 Kings 1.2.</note> who being faln from an upper Chamber tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a Latteſs, ſent to the God of <hi>Ekron,</hi> to know whether he ſhould recover of his diſeaſe (as too many do in theſe days, who ſend to Aſtronomers to know the events of things) not to the Phyſitian,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 16.12.</note> as <hi>Aſa</hi> King of <hi>Iuda</hi> did, who being diſeaſed in his feet, ſent to the Phyſitian, before he had called upon the Lord by prayer, for God is the Paramount Phyſitian, and the God of Nature and neither the Art of men, nor the hidden Vertues of drugs and Simples, are of any effect without his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: thirdly, the change of Air from bad to good, and the pleaſent proſpects of green Medows, corn Fields, beautiful Gardens,<note place="margin">The natural remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</note> and odiferuos Flowers, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Senſes are remedies againſt Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: fourthly, Honeſt and godly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and moderate Exerciſes, as Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Shooting and Bowling, divert and drive away Sorrow: fifthly, wholſom
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:122164:101"/>Diet, and broath with Chickens and Mutton, Borage, Buglos, Marigolds and yellow Flowers, with a cup or two of Claret Wine with Sugar, are excellent remedies againſt Grief and Sorrow. The Moral remedies are Fortitude, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Conſtancy, and Patience; for the uſe and practice of theſe Vertues are ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al antidotes againſt the venom of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: I do not allow of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,<note place="margin">The moral remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</note> who would have their wiſe men to be inſenſible of anguiſh in the midſt of the greateſt torments, nor to be ſad for the loſs of Parents, Wife, Children, or intimate Friends, for this is rather a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſtupidity then a true conſtancy; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I approve of an extream deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedneſs, or exceſſive ſorrow for the loſs or deprivation of any thing that is dear unto men, but of a moderate demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſinſibility required by Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Chriſtianity of ſuch a loſs; for ſuch as are truly wiſe are never tranſported with exceſſive Joy, nor with extream Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for any thing which befalleth them in proſperity or in adverſity, the <hi>medium</hi> temper being to be preferred before any extream; as for Fortitude, Temperance, and Conſtancy; I muſt acknowledg the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:122164:102"/>Heathen have out-gone in their Vertues the Chriſtians in theſe days,<note place="margin">The <hi>Pagans</hi> have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the Chriſtians in Moral Vertues.</note> as it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the lives and actions of divers of them, as of <hi>Ariſtides, Phocion, Epamonides, Scevola, Regulus, Fabricius</hi> and <hi>Cato;</hi> but for true Patience Chriſtians have out-gone them, as it may appear in the Book of Martyrs. Now becauſe Patience is not onely a moral Vertue, but alſo a divine Grace; I will ſpeak of it in the next Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, becauſe</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Remedies I am to ſpeak of have a coherence with the uſe of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sorrow; and the chiefeſt are theſe: firſt, Humility: ſecondly, Fortitude: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Patience, for the pride of mens hearts is the eſſential cauſe of all their ſorrows; the other cauſes being but branches of it,<note place="margin">The ſpiritual remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</note> as the of loſs Parents, Wife, Children, intimate Friends, Goods, Riches, Honor, Reputation, and the Anguiſh and Paines of their natural infirmities. Now if men endevor to obtain from God by fervent prayer theſe three graces, they will be able to regulate their greateſt ſorrows: firſt, If they acknowledg with all humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that all things they have are the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate gift of God, they will have no occaſion to be grieved, or to be ſorrowful
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:122164:102"/>when God, who was, and is the giver of them all, is pleaſed to take them away: And for inſtance, let the Humility, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and Patience of <hi>Job</hi> be their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and Preſident:<note place="margin">Job <hi>1.</hi>

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:122164:103"/>men caſt away all timerous fears that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ſorrow, for men are apt to grieve and ſorrow for imaginary evils that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend will come upon them (although there is no probability they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal them) as much as for thoſe which they ſuffer:<note place="margin">The ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual uſe of Sorrow.</note> Moreover, in Dolour and Anguiſh of the body; Fortitude gives men courage, and makes them to regard them no more then a Flea-bite: Laſtly, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence mixt with Hope, ſuffers all Griefs, Anguiſhes, ſorrows, afflictions, tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and perſecutions, as things that be of no continuance, for it teacheth men to know, <hi>That weeping</hi>

And in this as much as in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, is the incomprehenſible wiſdom of God viſibly ſeen, that he hath been pleaſed to ſtore men with Antidotes againſt all kinde of venoms and evils that might be deſtructive to them, and to their beeing; for were it not for this paſſion of Hope, men upon the leſt diſgraces, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, tribulations, and perſecutions of this world, would imbrace all manner of deſperate reſolutions, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves away, to be rid of the continual an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, grief, and ſorrow they are ſubject unto in this life. And I am perſwaded that the want that the Heathen had of this ſpiritual hope of the eternal joy to come, was the cauſe that ſo many of them laid violent hands upon themſelves: for ſome to be free from the imperious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations of their mortal enemies, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining out of a manly courage to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged for their lives to their clemency, have ripped up their own bowels with their ſwords,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Ceſar</hi> and <hi>Catoes</hi> lives.</note> as <hi>Cato</hi> did, rather then he would fall alive into the hands of <hi>Ceſar;</hi> and others to be rid of the exceſſive grief
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:122164:104"/>and ſorrow which did rack and torture their ſouls for the loſs of their beloved husbands, or intimate friends, have drunk Poyſon, or ſtifled themſelves with bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning coals, as did <hi>Portia</hi> for her dear huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands death, <hi>Martius Brutus.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, There are diverſe Definitions of Hope; ſome ſay it is but an expectation of the good:<note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of worldly Hope.</note> others ſay, It is nothing but a confidence that men have that ſuch things will happen to them, which they have conceived in their imagination:<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Others ſay, It is a paſsion of the ſoul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by upon the impreſsion that men have of ſome future good which is repreſented to their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination by the ſenſes, as difficult to obtain; whereupon they addict themſelves to an eager proſecution of it, conceiving to be able of themſelves to obtain the injoyment of the ſame. Hope,</hi> ſaith another, <hi>is a motion of the ſoul, that inticeth men to expect and ſeek after a good that is abſent, in which they ſee ſome probability to be obtained;</hi> and <hi>Senault</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with theſe two laſt Opinions, adds, that there can be no real hope, except there be an apparent poſſibility it may be obtained. Hope is then the firſt paſſion incident to the Iraſcible appetite, of great uſe to men, if they fix their hope upon vertuous, or religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</p>
               <p>Secondly, The cauſes that beget
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:122164:105"/>worldly Hope in the heart of carnal men; are theſe: firſt, a continual proſperity in their underſtandings doth puffe up their hearts with vain and deluding hopes that the ſame proſperity will ſtill continue, and accompany their deſigns to the end.<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Pompejus</hi> life.</note> 
                  <hi>Pompejus</hi> the great was deluded by this hope, for relying overmuch in the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous events he had formerly had in war (having never been foiled by any of his enemies) he neglected to raiſe a ſufficient Army to hinder <hi>Ceſars</hi> coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> as he was counſelled to do by his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friends, but hoping on his former proſperous ſucceſs, he ſaid unto them, If I do but ſtamp with my feet upon the ground, ſouldiers will iſſue out of it in all parts of <hi>Italy</hi> to ſide with me againſt <hi>Ceſar;</hi> but this vain hope was the cauſe of his utter overthrow, for he was inforced to forſake <hi>Italy</hi> to the mercy of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and to fly beyond the ſeas, where his Army was defeated, and himſelf conſtrained to ſave his life by ſhipping into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he was baſely murdered: ſecondly, Might and Power doth fill the hearts of carnal men with vain hopes; <hi>Xerxes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> relying upon his numerous Army of a million of men, hoped to over-run

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:122164:106"/>this paſſion of Hope then others, are:<note place="margin">Six cauſes of the worldly Hopes of men.</note> firſt, that they abound in ſpirits, for the Sanguin have more blood and ſpirits then the Cholerick, Flegmatick, or Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick men: ſecondly, they have time by their young age to proſecute the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their hopes; thirdly, they have ſtrength and activity to overcome all difficulties that ſeem to bar them from the injoyment of their hopes, whereas ancient men are more addicted to the paſſion of Fear then to Hope;<note place="margin">Three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why young men are more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Hopes then ancient men.</note> firſt, Becauſe their natural ſtrength, and vital ſpirits are waſted with age; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe their long experience hath made them more conſiderate then young men; thirdly, becauſe they have one foot in the grave, and have not time to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the injoyment of their hopes, and are better acquainted with the incertitude of the undertakings of men: fourthly, Men that are verſed in the affairs of the world, have their hearts filled with vain hopes, becauſe they think nothing impoſſible unto them, by reaſon that their long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the affairs of this world hath drawn them out of the ſnares of many perplexities: fifthly, Men that have been divers times in great dangers by Sea and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:122164:107"/>by Land, have their hearts filled with Hope when they fall into danger, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then to avoide the ſame, as they have done formerly: ſixthly, Men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danted ſpirits, have their hearts filled with vain hopes, becauſe the paſſion of Undantedneſs drives away all fears from their mindes, yet theſe come oftentimes ſhort of their hopes;<note place="margin">See the <hi>French</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</note> for <hi>Baligny</hi> one of the moſt undanted ſpirits of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, who had ſlain in Duel, or in ſingle Combat ſeventeen valiant Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen as any were in <hi>France,</hi> was ſlain himſelf in the ſtreets of <hi>Paris</hi> manfully by another Gentleman, who was reputed but a Novice in the feats of Arms. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mens hopes are for the greater part of a deluding Nature, if they be not grounded upon Reaſon and good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Objects of the Hope of worldly men are theſe: firſt, Honors: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Riches: thirdly, Pleaſures: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Self-ends, and Vain-glory; for all the hopes of carnal men are fixed upon one of theſe Objects,<note place="margin">The vanity and incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</note> and by conſequence their hopes muſt be meer vanity and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſpirit: firſt, Men that make Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors the Objects of their Hopes, will
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:122164:107"/>finde them to be grounded upon quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, for what is more ſubject to mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and change then worldly Honors? The Favorites of Princes are compared to Moucherons that grow up in one night,<note place="margin">Jonah 4.6, 7.</note> or to <hi>Jonahs</hi> Gourd that ſprouted and grew to its perfection in one day, and by a Worm was withered the next day, even ſo the honors of Favorites are taken away in a moment;<note place="margin">Eſther 4, 2. and 7.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Hamon</hi> the <hi>Agagite</hi> was promoted on a ſudden above all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that were with the great King <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus,</hi> but he loſt in a moment his life and his Honors, and ſuffered an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious death, for he was hanged on a Gibbet of fifty cubits high. <hi>Sejanus</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Great Favorite of the Emperor <hi>Tiberius Nero,</hi>

See <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in the life of <hi>Cyrus.</hi>

                  <hi>Creſſus</hi> King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> loſt all his incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Treaſures and his Kingdoms in a day; and <hi>Craſſus</hi> the richeſt <hi>Roman</hi> that ever was,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Craſſus</hi> life.</note> loſt his life and his unparallel'd riches by indeavouring to increaſe them: Riches are then a tottering foundation for mens hopes: thirdly, if mens Hopes be fixed upon worldly pleaſures, they are of leſs continuance then the fire of thorns under a Pot, for carnal pleaſures ſeem tedious in the continuance,<note place="margin">The vanity of worldly Pleaſures.</note> and mens eſtates will be ſooner waſted, and their bodies conſumed by lothſome diſeaſes, then they will beſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with carnal pleaſures: fourthly, Although Self-ends, and Vaine-glory are the ordinary objects of the Hopes of the moſt generous ſpirits, yet Vain-glory is but a meer ſhadow; and for Self-ends
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:122164:108"/>it is contemptible and baſe; for moral Hope which inticeth men to generous actions, cannot be pure if it be not free from Self-ends, and vain oſtentation;<note place="margin">The vanity of Self-ends, and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory.</note> and notwithſtanding, if the moſt heroical actions of the ancient and modern Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, both in Arms, and in learning, were well examined, few will be found, that were acted meerly for the love of Vertue, or the publique good, but were mixt with Self-ends, and Vain-glory: for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of <hi>Alexander</hi> and of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and of a hundred more, were to increaſe their fame and Dominions. And the learned Works of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> of <hi>Plate,</hi> of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> of <hi>Cicero,</hi> of <hi>Seneca,</hi> of <hi>Saluſt,</hi> and of many more, were written as much to perpetuate their memory, as for the love of Vertue, or of the Publick good. Mens Hopes muſt then have a more excellent object, and a more ſolid foundation then theſe before related, or they will prove to be but meer vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The nature and proprieties of this paſſion of worldly Hope are theſe: firſt, Although all worldly Hope is of an earthly nature, becauſe of its corruptible and tranſitory objects, yet it hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:122164:109"/>of agility, for it is as ſwift as the thoughts and deſire of men, for in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of time mens Hope may be here, in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Turky,</hi> or any where, where men have commerce or trading,<note place="margin">The nature and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of worldly Hopes.</note> acquaintance, or intimate friends: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The worldy Hope of men is as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant as the Windes, for ſometimes it is fixed upon Honors, other times upon Riches, and again upon Pleaſures, or upon this undertaking, or this other deſign, and alters according to mens fancies and imaginations: thirdly, the worldly Hope of men is ordinarily voide of Prudence, for it is extravagant, and oftentimes ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, becauſe it doth not take his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and diſtances aright, I mean, in fixing their Hopes upon impoſſibilities, which is the reaſon that ſo many are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded in their Hopes; divers unreaſonable creatures having by a natural ſagacity a better aim then they: for the Lyons, the Tygers, the Bares, and all other devouring beaſts will not ſet upon any other beaſt except they ſee ſome probability they may maſter them, for if they be too ſwift, or too ſtrong, they forbear to ſet upon them: nor the Kite will not offer to raviſh the young Chickens, if its ſees the Hen
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:122164:109"/>neer at hand to defend them,<note place="margin">The wilde beaſts, by a natural ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take nothing without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability they may attain.</note> nor the Hawk will not fly after the Partridge ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it ſees that ſhe is within her reach; but worldly men, for the greater part, fix their hopes upon objects, wherein there is no probability at all they ſhould attain to the injoyment of them, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the natural propriety of this paſſion of Hope; for true Hope eſchews all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities: fourthly, The worldly Hopes of men are inſatiable, as well as their Deſires, for when they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the fruition of one of their Hopes, they inſtantly fix their Hopes upon another object, ſo that the thirſt of an Hydropick will be ſooner quenched, then the worldly hope of men will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Albania</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a vain Hope of the conqueſt of <hi>Italy:</hi> but his wiſe, and prudent Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <hi>Cynias,</hi> perceiving no probability in this hope of his, becauſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth was then powerful, argued with his Prince after this manner; Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſaith he, my Liege, that Fortune be ſo favorable to you, as to grant you the fruition of your hopes,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> life.</note> in which I ſee ſmall probability, becauſe the <hi>Roman</hi> State is potent, and abounds in valiant
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:122164:110"/>and warlike men, and experienced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders; where will you then fix your hopes? <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> anſwered, when I ſhall have the poſſeſſion of <hi>Italy;</hi> I will croſs over into <hi>Sicilia</hi> and ſubdue that, and then, replied <hi>Cynias,</hi> where will you bend your Hopes? to conquer <hi>Carthage,</hi> ſaid <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and all the coaſts of <hi>Africa;</hi> and whether then ſaith <hi>Cynias?</hi> we will then, ſaith <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> return into <hi>Albania,</hi> and joy in our Conqueſt, and make good chear, and be merry: and who hinders you, ſaith <hi>Cynias,</hi> to be joyful, and make good chear, and be merry, ſith you have a rich Kingdom of your own, and abound in Treaſures, and in all things that your heart can deſire? my counſel is then, that you ſhould give bounds to your hopes, and prefer the certain to the uncertain events of Fortune. By this Inſtance onely, theſe things will be confirmed: firſt, That the hopes of men are inſatiable: ſecondly, That young and ſanguin men are moſt addicted to hopes, and to undertake hard and difficult enterpriſes: thirdly, That raſh, and inconſiderate hopes, void of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are always deceitful, and vaniſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſmoke; for this young and valiant Prince was deluded by his hopes, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:122164:110"/>was foiled in <hi>Italy</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in lieu of the conqueſt of <hi>Italy, of Sicilia, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> and the coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> after the ſhedding of his ſubjects blood, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting of his Treaſures, and the many hazards he was in to loſe his life, he was inforced to return into <hi>Albania,</hi> and was ſlain in the City of <hi>Argos</hi> by a woman, that did caſt a Tyle upon his head.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The effects of worldly hope may be theſe: firſt, it is Hope that incourageth generous ſpirits to undertake all hard and difficult enterpriſes: It was Hope that moved <hi>Alexander</hi> to forſake his Kingdom of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> to undertake the conqueſt of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and that made him leave a certain good for an imaginary hope of conqueſt, which had a proſperous ſucceſs againſt all human probabilities by the ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God,<note place="margin">The effects of worldly Hopes.</note> that the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy ſhould be transferred to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as it was fore-told by the Prophet <hi>Daniel.</hi> It was Hope that moved <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> King and Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> to undertake the conqueſt of the <hi>Weſt-Indies:</hi> and by Hope the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed to undertake the conqueſt of the third part of the Kingdoms of the earth;<note place="margin">See the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Hiſtory.</note> but all their hopes had no other object
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:122164:111"/>then ſelf-ends, and vain-glory: ſecondly, It is Hope that induceth Polititians,<note place="margin">See the <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Hiſtory.</note> and Stateſmen, to impaire their health, and tire their ſpirits, to dive into the myſteries of the Maximes, and Reaſons of State, to propagate the increaſe, honor, and glory of their native Countrey, as Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Ximenez</hi> did for <hi>Spain;</hi> and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de Riche-lieu</hi> for <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the <hi>French</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</note> yet their Hopes were mixt with ſelf-ends, and vain-glory: It is Hope that moves Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and Souldiers to venture their lives in the dangerous atchievements of war, under colour to fight for the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and increaſe of the peace and extent of the demains of their native Countrey, yet <hi>Marius Sylla,</hi> and <hi>Ceſar</hi> had a ſelf-end in all their Military exploits, tending more to the utter ſubverſion of the Liberties, and deſolation of their native Countrey, then to the increaſe of the good or glory of it: fourthly, It is Hope that inticeth Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to venture their means and lives at Sea; and Tradſmen, and Artificers to moyl and toyl; and the Husbandman to to endure the heat in Summer, and the cold blaſt of the Northerly windes in Winter;<note place="margin">Hope incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth men in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> nay, all the injuries of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors of the Air; but all their Hopes have
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:122164:111"/>no other object then their private gain, and to keep themſelves and their Families in a decent condition, and free from penury. This hope is neceſſary, and therefore more commendable then any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer (ſo it be kept within the bounds of moderation) becauſe it is profitable to the Common-wealth, without which it could not ſubſiſt; but the other are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to mankinde, for they are cauſe of much ſhedding of blood, and of the deſolation of Kingdoms: fifthly,<note place="margin">Moral Hope excels worldly Hope.</note> Moral Hope is better then wordly Hope, for it is a preſerver of Life, and the Moderator of Grief and Sorrow, and a Cordial againſt all Anguiſhes and Infirmities of the body, it ſupports men in their greateſt miſeries, and is the oppoſite of the paſſion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, for it moved a <hi>Rhodian</hi> who had been caſt into a dungeon ful of Adders and Snakes (for ſome horrid crimes by him committed) to uſe daily antidotes for his preſervation, and to anſwer to ſome that perſwaded him to rid himſelf by a violent way out of that miſery where he lay; no, ſaith he, as long as I have breath in my noſtrils, I will ever hope for my deliverance; and it is daily ſeen,<note place="margin">Hope for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes not men till death.</note> that the Gally-ſlaves, and thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:122164:112"/>to die, do ever hope to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed or reprived; and the ſickeſt, or the oldeſt man hath hope to recover, or to live one year longer: Nature having, as it ſeems, indowed men with this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Hope for the preſervation of their beeing, for as ſoon as Hope forſakes men they go the way of all fleſh, or fall into deſpaire: ſixthly, If Moral Hope be thus qualified, it will be of excellent uſe: firſt, Its objects muſt be a real good: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, This good muſt be abſent or to come: thirdly, It muſt be difficult to obtain: fourthly, It muſt have ſome probability that it may be obtained, for impoſſibilities deſtroy the nature and the proprieties of Hope. Vertue is then the true object of moral Hope, but it muſt be without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſelf-ends and Vain-glory. But</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Spiritual Hope is free from both, for it is a ſupernatual gift of God: The Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the eighth of the <hi>Romans</hi> makes a clear definition of it; <hi>Hope that is ſeen is not Hope,</hi>

               <p>There are divers ſorts of Deſpair, which may be reduced to theſe three: firſt, Worldly: ſecondly, Moral: thirdly, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. The worldly Deſpair is nothing elſe but a conceit of an impoſſibility in the acquiſition of the vain hopes of men, as it will appear in the Cauſes and Effects of that kinde of Deſpair. The definition of the Moral Deſpair, is according to the opinion of the beſt Moraliſts as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>Deſpair,</hi> ſaith <hi>Boujou,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Theophraſt Boujou <hi>Lord of</hi> Beaulieu fol. <hi>723.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>is a paſsion of the Soul, withdrawing men from ſome good much deſired, becauſe it is repreſented by the Senſes to their imagination, as impoſsible to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:122164:116"/>be obtained.</hi>

                  <hi>Deſpair,</hi> ſaith <hi>Senault, is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent motion of the ſoul, that keeps men aloof from the proſecution of ſome good, in which they ſee no probability it can be obtained.</hi> Now this good is not always a real good, for the Senſes do oftentimes delude the Reaſon and Judgment of men; but ſuppoſe it be a real good, then it is Vertue it ſelf, or ſome vertuous Object, Action, or Deſign w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they conceive impoſſible to be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or performed, for Moral Hope hath no other object then Vertue, or vertuous and generous actions, and by conſequence Moral Deſpair muſt have the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,<note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of worldly, moral, and ſpiritual deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair.</note> for divers of the ancient Moraliſts held Self-murdering no Deſpair, (as I have given a hint of it in the laſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) but an action of fortitude, and of magnanimity of courage. And this Moral Deſpair is the oppoſite, and great Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt of Moral Hope, and the ſecond paſſion incident to the Iraſcible appetite, which doth mitigate the extravagancy of mens Hopes, as it will appear in the inſuing Diſcourſes; yet men often times deſpair of things, in which they imagine impoſſibilities, when there is none, as it will appear by theſe two Inſtances, About ſixſcore years paſt, it was a thing
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:122164:116"/>thought impoſſible to ſail with a ſhip round about the circuit of the earth, and yet <hi>Magalen</hi> a <hi>Portugais,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</note> and Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> an <hi>Engliſh man</hi> have ſhown by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that it was poſſible to be done: ſecondly, In the days of <hi>Charls</hi> the ninth, <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, Kings of <hi>France;</hi> It was a thing thought impoſſible to take the City of <hi>Rochel</hi> by force or by famine, and yet the Cardinal <hi>de Riche-lieu</hi> by the Art of a <hi>French</hi> Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,<note place="margin">See the <hi>French</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</note> hath ſhown by experience it was poſſible to be done, for by a floating bridge that he made over an Arm of the Sea, upon which he planted Ordinances, and erected two Towers, and with a land Army, <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth King of <hi>France,</hi> took that City by famine in leſs then a year; whereupon I conclude, that men Deſpair of things by imagining im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities where there is none, and this proceeds from want of judgment, power, or experience, for it is daily ſeen, that which ſeems to be impoſſible to one man, is eaſie and facile to another. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Deſpair is nothing elſe but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt of Gods mercy, which by the temptation of Satan, do intice men to be the murderers of themſelves, which is
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:122164:117"/>the next ſin to the ſin of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The cauſes of worldly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair may be theſe: firſt, The death of a beloved party;<note place="margin">See <hi>Bandel</hi> in his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ries.</note> 
                  <hi>Romelio</hi> ſuppoſing his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Miſtreſs <hi>Iuliete</hi> to be dead, when ſhe was but in a ſwound, ſlew himſelf upon her body, and when ſhe came to her ſelf again, ſhe ſeeing her Sweet-Heart had killed himſelf for her ſake, ſhe ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed her ſelf with his Poynard: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The infidelity in love is a cauſe of Deſpair;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Virgils Aeneads.</note> 
                  <hi>Dido</hi> Queen of <hi>Carthage</hi> ſlew her ſelf, becauſe <hi>Aeneas</hi> a <hi>Trojan</hi> Prince for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook her and ſailed into <hi>Italy:</hi> but if this be a Poeticall Fable, hear a true Relation. A proper young maiden being ſecretly betrothed to a young man living here in <hi>London,</hi> who broke his faith, and married another; whereupon the maiden being tranſported with Deſpair poiſoned her ſelf, and died the next day, this hapned within this twelve moneth. I could relate a hundred ſuch inſtances, to prove that of all the paſſions, Love being abuſed, or extinguiſhed by death, doth ſooner then any other thing beget Deſpair, but I paſs them over for brevity ſake: thirdly, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice is the cauſe of Deſpair; A Merchant
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:122164:117"/>in <hi>London</hi> of good means, having had ſome loſſes at ſea, and having received the tidings of it on the Saturday; he being tranſported with Deſpair, hung himſelf on the Sunday morning when his ſervants were at Church; and it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing among the Cormorant Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, when they have Monopolized all the corn of a County into their hands, to hang or drown themſelves, if the next year prove to be a fruitful year: fourthly, Famine is a cauſe of Deſpair,<note place="margin">2 Kings 6.29.</note> for in <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rams</hi> days, ſuch a famine was in <hi>Samaria,</hi> that two women boiled a childe, and did eate the ſame, the mother of the childe out of Deſpair conſenting to it; and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will be pleaſed to read <hi>Ioſephus</hi> will ſee the horrid actions of ſome of the <hi>Iews</hi> committed out of Deſpair, becauſe of the great famine that was at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> when it was beſieged by the <hi>Romans:</hi> fifthly, The fear to fall into the hands of a cruel enemy cauſeth Deſpair, ſome of the richeſt of the <hi>Saguntines,</hi> rather then they would fall into the hands of <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> and his cruel <hi>Carthaginian</hi> and <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midian</hi> ſouldiers,<note place="margin">See <hi>Titus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> in his third <hi>Decade. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 34.</note> did carry all their wealth, with their wives and children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Market place, and having made a
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:122164:118"/>great heap of their rich moveables they ſet the fire in it, and ſlew their wives and children, and having caſt them into the fire they ſlew themſelves afterwards: ſixtly, Shame is a cauſe of Deſpair; <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi> Queen of <hi>Egypt</hi> being informed that it had been reſolved in the Counſel of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Ceſar,</hi> that ſhe ſhould be led as a captive after the triumphant Chariot of the ſaid Emperor, when he ſhould make his entry into <hi>Rome;</hi> out of Deſpair to avoid that ſhame,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> life.</note> ſhe applied two Vipers to her two breaſts, and ſo died. There are divers other cauſes of worldly Deſpair, but they are of another nature, for they attain not to that exorbitant degree of Self-murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but draw men off from their vain hopes, and raſh enterpriſes; of which I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak in the Effects of this paſſion of Deſpair.</p>
               <p>The Cauſes of Moral Deſpair proceed from the fatall events from generous and Martial achievements, or from the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of affairs of State: firſt, after the Battel of <hi>Cannae,</hi> that <hi>Hanibal</hi> won upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> the young Nobility that fled and ſaved themſelves from the rout of it, were ſo tranſported with Deſpair, that they reſolved to fly out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and had
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:122164:118"/>done ſo, but for <hi>Publius Scipio,</hi> who hearing of their reſolution,<note place="margin">See <hi>Titus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> in his third <hi>Decade, lib.</hi> 3.</note> came amongſt them, and after a ſharp cenſure for their puſillanimity made them ſwear never to forſake him till he had been avenged upon <hi>Hanibal</hi> for the ſhame the <hi>Romans</hi> had received at <hi>Cannae:</hi> And by their means was he elected by the voyce of the People to go as General into <hi>Africa,</hi> to inforce <hi>Hanibal</hi> by a diverſion of war, to withdraw his forces out of <hi>Italy:</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were ſo tranſported with Fear and Deſpair after the laſt overthrow that <hi>Scipio</hi> gave them not far from <hi>Carthage,</hi> where he routed <hi>Hanibal</hi> and <hi>Iuba</hi> King of the <hi>Numidians,</hi> that they loſt all hope and courage, and made a moſt ſhameful peace with the <hi>Romans,</hi> for they did deliver up unto them all their ſhipping: But contrarily after the loſs of three famous battels that <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> won upon the <hi>Romans;</hi> Hope infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their courage, and by it, from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered People, they became Conquerors; A good caveat for Princes or States, to diſſwade them from Deſpairing, in the diſmal events of war, but to foment hope in their breaſt in their greateſt diſgraces; for if Deſpair creap in mens hearts that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:122164:119"/>hold the Helm of the ſhip of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,<note place="margin">See <hi>Titus Iavius</hi> in his third <hi>Decade, lib.</hi> 3.</note> all goes to wrack: thirdly, <hi>Charls</hi> the ſeventh, King of <hi>France,</hi> was for ſometime ſo poſſeſſed with Deſpair by the evil events that his men of war had daily with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Armies that were under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> that he ſuffered his own, and publick affairs to go to ruine, till his Concubine <hi>La bella Agnes,</hi> by the perſwaſion of the <hi>French</hi> Peers,<note place="margin">See <hi>du Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> in his <hi>French</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</note> and ſome of his chiefeſt, and moſt faithful Commanders of war in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Hope into his heart, by ſaying unto him, that ſhe was minded to leave him, for ſhe had been told, that ſhe ſhould be the Miſtreſs of the moſt valourous Prince in Chriſtendom, and ſhe ſaw nothing but puſillanimity in him, for he did ſuffer the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to rent his Kingdom in piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meals: This coming from a woman, filled the King with indignation, and with the hopes that the <hi>Pucelle</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> as they called her, gave him to raiſe the ſiege of <hi>Orleans,</hi> that was then beſieged by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he took from that time forward his, and the publick affairs to heart, and became a valorous Prince: fourthly, In the beginning of the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth King of <hi>France,</hi> the true

               <p>Fourthly, The good effects of the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Deſpair may be theſe: firſt, It anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilates and turneth to ſmoak, all the vain and extravagant hopes of men that are fixed upon impoſſibilities:<note place="margin">Four good effects of Deſpair.</note> ſecondly, It doth quench the burning flames of love, and clips the wings of preſumptuous Lovers, who fly too high with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that would otherwiſe rack and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their mindes, and make them daily ſigh and groan, becauſe they could not obtain the enjoyment of that object, that is too rare and excellent for their degree; but Deſpair coming on, makes them deſiſt from the proſecution of things in which there is no probability they can be obtained: thirdly, it mitigates the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious hopes of Princes, who would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing impoſſible to them becauſe of their might and power, if this faithful

The Black Prince having entred <hi>France</hi> with an Army of ſome ten thouſand men, and taken divers ſtrong holds in <hi>Poytou; Iohn</hi> then King of <hi>France,</hi> came againſt him with an Army of thirty thouſand men; the Prince ſeeing himſelf over-matched, by the means of the <hi>Popes Nuncio</hi> deſired to come to a Treaty, and offered to the <hi>French</hi> King to reſtore unto him all the ſtrong holds he had taken, and to make good the damages he had received, ſo he might peaceably retreat with his Army into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitain,</hi> that did then belong to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England;</hi> but King <hi>Iohn,</hi> a raſh and inconſiderate Prince, required greater things, which ſtood not with the Princes honor to grant, and ſo was inforced out of Deſpair to fight whether he would or no; and being an excellent ſouldier, ſeated his Camp in a high ground full of thorns and buſhes, which he lined with his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:122164:123"/>Archers, and cauſed in the night time a deep ditch to be caſt up about his Camp, to break the fury of the <hi>French</hi> horſe; the <hi>French</hi> in the morning, in ſtead to ſend their foot to make a paſſage through this ditch, ſent their horſe, who falling atop of one another in the ditch were ſlain by the Archers, and the battel of the <hi>French</hi> diſordered; whereupon the Prince came upon them with his whole Army, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a famous victory, and took King <hi>Iohn</hi> and his youngeſt ſon <hi>Philip le Hardy,</hi> that was afterwards Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> priſoners, and a great number of the <hi>French</hi> Nobility; which confirms that extream Deſpair makes men fight like Lyons, and that wiſe Princes are rather to make golden bridges for their enemies to retreat, then by deſpair to enforce them to fight. To conclude, Deſpair is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous paſſion, and Self-murdering De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair is to be abhorred of Chriſtians, for it doth not onely deſtroy the body, but it doth alſo caſt mens ſouls into the pit of eternal wo.

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:122164:124"/>effects which proceed from theſe, are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be imputed to keepers of the Patients, then to themſelves, or to the fury of the diſeaſe, and therefore cannot come within the compaſs of Self murder.

               <p>IF Diamonds were as common as Pipples, and Vertues as natural to men as Vices, they would not be ſo precious, nor valued at ſo high a rate as they are in theſe days, for it is the rarity of things more then their goodneſs that makes them to be eſteemed among men: for Inſtance, Bread is the only ſtaff of mans life, and the beſt food that Nature hath appointed for his ſubſiſtence, and yet
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:122164:126"/>becauſe it is common, it is little regarded, for Beggers will hardly give men thanks if they give them nothing but dry bread. But this paſſion I am to ſpeak of, is not onely rare, (ſith one man among one hundred is not indowed with it) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo good and excellent, and therefore the more to be eſteemed and valued of men, as a rare and precious Jewel: By it mens hopes are attained, all fears expelled, and deſpair ſuppreſſed, and were it not a Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhould call it a Vertue, becauſe of the reſemblance it hath with Fortitude: For Undantedneſs is the Spring of all true Valour and manly courage, and by it all the generous actions that have been acted ſince the Creation till this day, have had their beeing and ſucceſsful end: And therefore moſt judiciouſly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly placed by the Moraliſts after De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and before Fear, to mitigate by the excellent proprieties of it, the evil quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the two others; for were it not for this paſſion, men would be diverted from undertaking any noble deſign by Fear and Deſpair, who have a natural proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to withdraw the vitall ſpirits into the Center of the body, which hinders the natural faculties to do and execute their

The Cauſes of it are many, but they may be reduced to theſe ſix; the two firſt are Natural, the two middlemoſt acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental, and the two laſt ſupernatural:<note place="margin">The firſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſe of undanted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is a hot and moiſt temper of the body.</note> The firſt Natural cauſe may be a moiſt and hot temper of the body; for the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts</hi> have obſerved, that all ſuch as are of that conſtitution of body have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily an undanted ſpirit: The Natural reaſon of it is, that this hot and moiſt
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:122164:127"/>temper doth ſuppreſs the Melancholick humor, and its evil proprieties and effects, whereby the blood that is hot and airy, an ful ofvital ſpirits, and the <hi>bilia</hi> that is dry and fiery, and the flegm that is cold and moiſt, being thus mixt become of a dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive nature, and by the motion of the heart, ſpread themſelves into all the utmoſt parts of the body, and inableth the minde to undertake, and the body to execute all maner of generous deſigns, be they never ſo difflcult or perillous. The ſecond na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſe of Undantedneſs may be the largeneſs of the heart of men, for it hath been obſerved by the Phyſitians, when they have opened the bodies of valiant and undanted ſpirits, that their hearts were larger then the hearts of ordinary men;<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Themiſtocles.</hi>

The Natural reaſon
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:122164:128"/>why men with larger hearts then others ſhould be addicted to Valour and Undan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs, is this, that the larger the heart is, the morevital ſpirits it can contain, which are the eſſential cauſes of Valour and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantedneſs; and therefore it may very well be that the largeneſs of the heart is a natural cauſe of Undantedneſs:<note place="margin">That tall and burly men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly leſs valorous then ſhort and middle ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtured men.</note> Divers men are of opinion, that tall and burly bodied men are more addicted to Valour and Undantedneſs then ſhort and middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatur'd men, but they are miſtaken, for tall men have ſmaller hearts then others, and are alſo commonly more faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted then other men; and the Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts give this reaſon for it; If their hearts, ſay ſay, were proportionable to their body, they might have reaſon to be of that opinion, but it is commonly ſmaller, becauſe Nature extended its vertue to the utmoſt parts, deprives the inward parts of it: Beſides, all the vitall ſpirits reſide in the bloud, and in the heart, and by its motion they are diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through all the parts of the body: Now the farther diſtant theſe parts are from the heart, the longer time are the vital ſpirits a going to quicken and vivifie them; and by conſequence tall and burly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:122164:128"/>men are fuller of Fleſh then of Spirits, and leſs couragious then others. It is true, that they have a preſuming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantedneſs, becauſe of their ſtrength, but what is done by ſtrength proceeds from Strength and not from Valour, which doth reſide in the heart, and in the minde, and not in the arms, and in the ſinews. And the moſt valorous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danted ſpirits of this Age, and of other Ages, were for the moſt part ſhort, or at the moſt of a middle ſtature; <hi>Leonidas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Peleopidas</hi> life.</note> and <hi>Peleopidas</hi> were but ſhort men; and Sir <hi>Francis Veere,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and the Marſhal <hi>de Biron,</hi> and the Marſhal <hi>Gaſtion</hi> were all ſhort men: I conclude then, that Valour and undantedneſs doth reſide in the heart and minde, and not in the ſtrength of the body, and that ſome of all ſtatures may be valiant and undant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The firſt accidentall cauſe may be the innocency of men, and the juſtice of their Cauſe, for as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Prov. 28.1.</note>

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:122164:129"/>the lives of their wives and children, and all the means they have, they fight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly like Lyons. The ſecond acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cauſe of Undantedneſs may be, The relations, ſupport, or alliances that men have with potent and powerful Princes or States, for the confidence they have to be backt and ſupported by them, doth make them undertake with undanted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage difficult and perillous enterpriſes;<note place="margin">The two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinentall cauſes of the undanted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men.</note> for Inſtance, The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> a ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, being at the firſt ſupported by <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth King of <hi>France,</hi> have for many years together undantedly waged war with the great King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and likewiſe the Kingdom of <hi>Sweden,</hi> a petty Kingdom, in compariſon of the Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> being ſupported by <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> hath with an undanted courage waged war many years with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>

                  </note> Thirdly, The firſt ſupernatural cauſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantedneſs of men, may be their zeal to Religion, for men do commonly fight like Lyons for the preſervation of the true Religion, as the Proteſtants have done in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> who were but a handful in compariſon of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:122164:129"/>and yet they have obtained divers famous victories over them.

The ſecond ſupernatural cauſe of undantedneſs may be the true eonfidence that men have in the Omnipotency of God, who is able by ſmall means, nay, without means if it pleaſeth him, to make them obtain unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Victories, and come off with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and reputation, from the moſt peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enterpriſes they undertake, as it ſhall be proved by inſtances, when I ſhall ſpeak of the Effects of Undantedneſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Nature and Proprieties of this Paſſion of Undantedneſs will beſt appear in a comparative way: by ſhewing the differences there are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and Temerity: firſt, undanted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ever accompanied with Prudence

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:122164:130"/>ſuch offences and injuries which blemiſh the honour of their Prince or Countrey, but ſuch as are poſſeſſed with temerity, vindicate with ſeverity the offences done to themſelves, and connive at thoſe that are done to their Prince, or native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. It hath been a ſubject of much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate among the Moraliſts, which of theſe two famous Conquerors, <hi>viz. Alexander</hi> or <hi>Ceſar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Quinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Curtius</hi> in <hi>Alexanders</hi> life.</note> did excel one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in Undantedneſs of courage; the greater part hold that <hi>Alexander</hi> in his actions had ſhewn to have more temerity then prudence and true undanted valour, and that <hi>Ceſar</hi> in his actions had been more unjuſt, but leſs temerary, and had far excelled <hi>Alexander</hi> in Valour and Courage: firſt, The undertaking of the conqueſt of <hi>Aſia</hi> by <hi>Alexander,</hi> was more juſt then <hi>Ceſars;</hi> for he undertook to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, that had ever been a mortall enemy to the <hi>Greeks;</hi> but <hi>Ceſar</hi> undertook to ſuppreſs the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his native Country that had raiſed him to his honors and dignities, and had intruſted him with their Armies for their defence, and not for their overthrow: ſecondly, All the Actions of <hi>Ceſar</hi> but one, (that was when he commanded the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:122164:131"/>Maſter of a Ship to croſs the ſea in a moſt impetuous ſtorm,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Ceſars</hi> life.</note> ſaying, Fear not, for thou carrieſt in thy Ship <hi>Ceſar</hi> and his Fortune; which ſavored over-much of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity) were guided with much Wiſdom and Prudence; but all the Actions of <hi>Alexander</hi> were guided by vaine hopes, and his undertakings were raſh and teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, for there was no humane probability that an Army of fourty thouſand foot, and ten thouſand horſe ſhould be able to encounter and foile, two or three milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, but they were raw, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced ſouldiers, whereas <hi>Ceſar</hi> had to oppoſe the moſt expert Commanders and well trained ſouldiers that were in the world, his onely excepted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his undanted courage was far the greater in over-coming of them. But ſome will object, How came it then to paſs that their actions were ſo ſucceſsful and fortunate, ſith the firſt were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Temerity, and the ſecond with Injuſtice? It may be anſwered, God in his infinite Wiſdom had long before decreed that <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould give the laſt period to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy,<note place="margin">Dan. 7.6.7.</note> and be the firſt Erector of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and <hi>Ceſar</hi> the firſt Founder of the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:122164:131"/>
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, which was to excel in Strength and Power all the former Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies; and it was Gods Wil and Decree that gave their Temerary, and unjuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns ſuch ſucceſs, and not their prudence, nor undantedneſs.<note place="margin">The evil ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantedneſs when it is abuſed.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Effects of Undanted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are of two ſorts, Evil and Good, the evil proceed from the abuſe that men make of ſo noble a Paſſion, but the good are eſſential and natural to it: firſt, As there is nothing ſo good, but may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by the corrupt and depraved incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of men; even ſo this noble Paſſion whoſe natural object is Vertue, Prudence, and Juſtice, is extraordinarily abuſed by the evil intentions of men, who make it the Emiſſary of their wrath and revenge.<note place="margin">Gen. 34.26.</note> The undanted courage of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> was by them made the agent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of their cruel revenge upon all the Inhabitants of <hi>Shechem,</hi> and upon <hi>Hamar</hi> and <hi>Shechem,</hi> the Father and the Son; and had not God out of his mercy towards the old Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> been pleaſed to ſend a panick fear upon the Cities that were round about them,<note place="margin">Gen. 35.5.</note> their raſh temerity had been the cauſe of their utter ruine: ſecondly, The undant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  </note> fourthly, The undanted courage of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and of the Marſhal <hi>de Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> was made by their exceſſive ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the inſtrument of the deſolations that hapned in the civil war of <hi>France,</hi> and of the troubles that hapned in <hi>Henry</hi> the fourths dayes, and of their own diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and fatall end: whereby it appears, that if Valour and Undantedneſs of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage be abuſed, and are not accompanied with Prudence and Juſtice, that it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive paſſion to mankinde, and to the owners themſelves.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the vanity of the paſsion of Fear.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS nothing can be ſo good, but it may be abuſed, ſo nothing can be ſo evil, but good uſe may be made of it. Wine is excellent and good, for it hath a natural propriety to rejoyce the heart;<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.15.</note> and yet divers men abuſe Wine, and by the immoderate drinking of it, become worſe then bruit Beaſts, becauſe they deprive themſelves of Judgment and Reaſon. The Viper is naturally rank poyſon, and yet the Mithridate, and other Antidotes againſt venoms, are compoſed of it; even ſo this paſſion of Fear is much abuſed, and made worſe then it is, although it proceed from an evil ſpring, I mean, the weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of men; yet God is pleaſed to make good uſe of it to convert ſinners, and to make them proſecute with greater fervency, then they would otherwiſe do, the ways of Righteouſneſs. Divers conceive Fear to be a Feminine paſſion, and unworthy to be harbored in a Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:122164:135"/>Breſt; yet it maketh the proudeſt of men to be cautious, and circumſpect in their undertakings, and clips the wings of their vain hopes, and ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes. <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">See <hi>Tasitus</hi> in the life of <hi>Nero.</hi>
                  </note> That it ſerves as a curb to the licentious will of Princes, and of all others that are in power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and for inſtance ſaith, That as long as <hi>Agrippina,</hi> the mother of the Emperor <hi>Nero</hi> lived, of whom he ſtood in fear, his actions were not ſo exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly wicked, as after her death; but he having like a graceleſs ſon, deprived her of life, took free liberty to commit the greateſt impieties that his heart could imagine. And <hi>Joaſh</hi> King of <hi>Juda</hi> did the like; for as long as <hi>Jehojada,</hi> the high Prieſt lived, whom he feared, he ſeemed to love the Lord; but ſoon after his death, he gave himſelf over to Idolatry and cruelty; for like an ungrateful wretch, he cauſed <hi>Zechariah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chro. 24.17, 22.</note> the ſon of <hi>Jehojada</hi> to be ſlain, becauſe he onely delivered unto him, the meſſage he had received from the Lord. Divers prefer Love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Fear; but there cannot be any true Love without Fear. Others ſay, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be feared, then beloved, but it is better to be equally loved and feared;
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:122164:136"/>for men without Love, endevor to be rid of the object of their Fears: But if men be beloved and feared; this compoſure keeps off all danger, and begets ſecurity and obedience: Neither can there be any filial obedience without Love; for the obedience that proceeds from Fear, is not free,<note place="margin">Prov. 1.7. and 20.2.</note> but forced. <hi>The fear of the Lord, is the beginning of knowledg. And the fear of a King is as the roaring of a Lyon; who ſo provoketh him to anger, ſinneth againſt his own ſoul.</hi> How much more ſhould men be afraid to provoke Gods wrath by their ſins? and yet that is one of their leaſt fears; for they fear thoſe things which they ſhould not fear, and fear not to ſin, which they ſhould moſt fear. But ſith the fear of the Lord, is the beginning of wiſdom, and of all ſaving knowledg; which knowledg doth teach men to be afraid of ſin, which is the greateſt evil: Give me leave to inlarge my diſcourſe upon theſe enſuing particulars, that you may know to fear nothing but ſin.</p>

Fear,</hi> ſaith another,<note place="margin">The Biſhop of <hi>Marſeille, p.</hi> 408.</note> 
                  <hi>is nothing elſe, but a Grief and Dolor of the ſoul, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending an evil at hand; in which men ſee little probability it can be eſchewed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it aims at the annihilation of their Being, or to ſome diſmal diſgrace, that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their life or eſtate.</hi> Yet it will appear by the nature, the proprieties and effects of Fear; that men are rather tranſported with Fears of imaginary Evils, then of real; and that mens fears do but rarely proceed from the annihilation of their Being: However, it is the fourth paſſion, incident to the irraſcible Appetite, and the oppoſite and great Antagoniſt to the noble paſſion of Undantedneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The nature of Fear is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the nature of Joy; for Joy dilates the blood, and the vital ſpirits reſiding in it, from the heart, to the utmoſt
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:122164:137"/>parts of the body; contrarily Fear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws the blood from the extreams of the body to the heart, becauſe Fear is a cold paſſion; and the heart finding this cold to oppreſs it, withdraws, and calls as it were, the blood and vital ſpirits from the further parts of the body to his ayd, that by their natural heat, he may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived and cheriſhed. And that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why divers men and women have been deprived of life, by a ſudden fear or fright, becauſe this cold paſſion congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the blood about the heart, as a great froſt congealeth water into Ice; but if the Fear be not ſo violent, yet it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a great alteration in the body; for mens and womens faces will become as white as a cloth, and ſometimes all their members will tremble as a leaf; and the motion proceeding from this alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is ſo ſwift, and forcible, that women great with-childe, miſcarry by it; nay, it doth oftentimes turn the childe in their womb, which depriveth the mother, and the childe of life. But Fear and Dolor have a great reſemblance one with the other; for they have both this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing quality, and are both of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream cold and dry nature; and therefore
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:122164:137"/>Fear and Sorrow are compared to the Winter Seaſon, and Joy and Delectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Spring and Summer, in which the vegetative Creatures ſprought and ſpring out their branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits; but in Winter time, they withdraw their ſap, which is their life, into their Roots, as Fear and Sorrow doth draw the blood and vital ſpirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the heart; that is the eſſential cauſe and motion of mens lives: Having both one and the ſame end, the vegetatives to preſerve themſelves from the Froſt and Snow, and the heart to warm and cheriſh it ſelf, againſt theſe cold and froſty paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Fear and Sorrow.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The cauſes of mens fears are many, and of ſeveral natures; and by conſequence, their remedies muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable unto them: I will therefore ſpeak firſt of the cauſes, and to every cauſe apply the remedy; but as I have ſaid a little before, mens fears do oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner proceed from imaginary evils, then from the real; and the worſt propriety of this paſſion of Fear is, That it anticipates, and creates Fears in the Minde, the real effects of which evils, oftentimes are not like to trouble ſuch as apprehend them,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:122164:138"/>nor their childrens children; which kinde of Fear proceeds from a diſtruſt of Gods providence, and therefore as odious to God as any other kinde of Fear, as it ſhall be proved, when I come to ſpeak of the effects of this paſſion. Firſt, Worldly men Fear to looſe their honors and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. Secondly, Their treaſures and riches. Thirdly, The enjoyment of their delights and pleaſures. Theſe three fading, and vaniſhing things, are the moſt common cauſes of mens fears: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies againſt theſe, are, Firſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>that there are not many noble called;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.26.28.</note> 
                  <hi>and that the things which are moſt deſpiſed, God hath choſen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 23.5.</note> Secondly, <hi>That riches certainly make themſelves wings, they flie away as an Eagle towards heaven.</hi> Thirdly, That pleaſures are of no continuance, and leave a ſting in the conſcience at their departure,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 2.11.</note> and are but <hi>meer vanity and vexation of Spirit.</hi> Fourthly, Men fear Poverty, and to prevent the ſame, addict themſelves for the greater part to unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful courſes of gain, remembring not this wiſe ſaying of <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 28.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>He that maketh haſte to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.</hi> Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is no Vice, and yet men abhor Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty more then any Vice, nay, more then
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:122164:138"/>Sin, the worſt of evils. The remedy againſt Poverty, is Contentedneſs; for many beleeve they are poor, when they are rich; and many think themſelves rich, when they are poor. As Chriſt ſaid to the Angel of the Church of the <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceans, Becauſe thou ſayeſt, I am rich,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 3.14.</note> 
                  <hi>and increaſed with goods, and have need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blinde, and naked.</hi> Contentedneſs is a gift, and grace of God; for if men be never ſo rich, and want that grace, they are but poor and miſerable, and like <hi>Cormorants</hi> that can never be ſatisfied. This Fear alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Diſtruſt, and the remedy of it, is to relie upon Gods providence, and on this precept, and promiſe of our bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saviour. <hi>Which of you, by taking thought,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 6.27, 28, 29, 31, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>can adde one cubit unto his ſtature? and why take ye thought for rayment? Conſider the Lillies of the field, how they grow; they toyl not, neither do they ſpin. And yet I ſay unto you, That</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of theſe.</hi> And in the 31, 33. Verſes. <hi>Therefore take no thought, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, What ſhall we eat, or what ſhall we drink, or wherewith ſhall we be clothed? But ſeek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:122164:139"/>and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> Fifthly, Men fear to loſe their wives, women their husbands, Parents their children, and children their Parents, and one friend another: But this Fear proceeds from the want, they conceive, they will have of their help, and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The remedy to this Fear, is this conſideration, That all men are mortal, and <hi>that all are of the duſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.20.</note> 
                  <hi>and all turn to duſt again.</hi> And let not Chriſtians have leſs conſtancy then a Heathen; to whom tidings being brought,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Morals.</note> that his onely ſon was dead, he anſwered, I knew he was not begotten to be immortal; and to utterly root out this Fear, which proceeds from the diſtruſt of the want of their ayd or aſſiſtance, let men have always in their minde,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> this ſaying of Saint <hi>Paul, All things work together for good to them that love God.</hi> Sixthly, Men fear perſecutions, tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and afflictions: This Fear proceeds from the infirmity of the fleſh, and from the puſillanimity of mens mindes, and from an antipathy of nature, who ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth Anguiſh and Dolor: The remedy of this Fear, is Fortitude, and an undant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courage; with this aſſurance, That by tribulations and croſſes, God is pleaſed
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:122164:139"/>oftentimes to call his children to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and make them more fervent and zealous in the ways of Righteouſneſs. As the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.67.</note> 
                  <hi>Before I was afflicted, I went aſtray, but now I have kept thy word.</hi> Seventhly, Men fear baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and long impriſonments: This Fear alſo proceeds from want of a Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine courage; for a Heathen could ſay, when he was baniſhed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Morals.</note> That the whole world was his Native Countrey. The onely remedy againſt this Fear, is Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and as the priſon doth retain mens bodies, ſo it may, if they make good uſe of their baniſhment and impriſonment, refrain them from ſin, and increaſe their Moral vertues, and Spiritual Graces.<note place="margin">Acts 16.25.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> prayed, and ſung <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and praiſed God in priſon. And Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> and <hi>La Nove,</hi> have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves famous by the learned Works they have written in priſon.<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in their lives.</note> And <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> did improve their learning, and Moral vertues, in their exile or baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Eightly, Men fear lingring and tedious Diſeaſes; as the Conſumption of the Lungs, the Hectick Fever, and the waſting of the Liver: But this Fear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from their natural infirmitie, that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:122164:140"/>is impatient of pain; for lingring Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes prepare men for repentance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſudden diſeaſes deprive them often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of that Grace. The remedy againſt this Fear, is to ſeek to the Lord, before men ſeek after the Phyſitians; for the iſſues of life and death, are in his hands. <hi>Ezekiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 20.2, 6, 7.</note> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> was ſoon cured of his Mortal diſeaſe, becauſe he called and prayed unto the Lord, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned ſincerity of heart. Ninthly, Men fear to fall into a decrepit age: A vain and ridiculous Fear, ſith the oldeſt man alive doth commonly hope, and deſire to live a yeer longer. It is true, that if decrepit age and poverty do meet, it may be called, The Miſery of Miſeries; for beſides the many infirmities that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to decrepit age, the waywardneſs common to it, is the moſt inſupportable, for it maketh all things diſtaſtful unto them; and being deprived by Poverty, of all worldly comforts, this aggravates far more the miſery of decrepit age. The remedy of it, is to attend with patience, the time appointed by the Lord, of the ſeparation of the body and ſoul, and to ſay with old <hi>Simeon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 2 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace, according to thy
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:122164:140"/>word; for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation.</hi> Tenthly and laſtly, Men are afraid of death, and eſpecially the wicked, becauſe it deprives them of their honors, riches, and pleaſures (the injoyment of which, is their Paradiſe upon Earth) and ferries them over to the eternal woes. But death is welcom to the children of God; for they account death as their deliverer, who frees them from the continual miſeries, and afflictions of this world, who are commonly their portion in this life; for they are aſſured, that the ſting of death hath been taken away, and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of their ſins hath been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at a dear rate, <hi>viz.</hi> By the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the precious blood of the onely Son of God, our bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore defie death, and ſay to her face, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.55.</note> 
                  <hi>O grave, where is thy victory? The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the the Law; but thanks be to God, which giveth us victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The Effects of this Paſſion of Fear, are of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Evil and Good: The firſt evil effect of it, is,<note place="margin">The evil effects of Fear.</note> That it dants the courage of men, and makes valiant Souldiers become cowards; and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:122164:141"/>this is called a Panick Fear: The <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories are full of inſtances to prove it, which I will paſs over for brevity ſake, and will onely relate this enſuing,<note place="margin">See <hi>Philip de Commines</hi> in the War of the Publike good; for ſo it was called, or the battel <hi>de Monlebery.</hi>
                  </note> recorded by <hi>Philip de Commines.</hi> In the beginning of the reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, King of <hi>France,</hi> the Duke <hi>Charls</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Officers of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> joyned with him, raiſed a great Army, and came neer to <hi>Paris,</hi> againſt the ſaid King; who hearing of their approach, came againſt them with another great Army, and having both pitched their Camp, within a mile one of another, with a reſalution to give battel; the next day it fell out to be a miſty morning, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Troops of Horſe being on both ſides ſent out, to diſcover the intentions of both Armies, they ſaw as they imagined, a great range of Lanciers ſtanding on a high ground, the Bourgonians conceiving they came towards them; and the French imagining they came towards their Camp; and ſo tranſported both with a Panick fear, they fled as hard as they could drive towards their Camp, and raiſed a fearful alarm, ſaying, The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were at hand; and ſo put both
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:122164:141"/>Armies into a ſtrange confuſion; but when the Sun had diſperſed the miſt, it was apparently ſeen that theſe imaginary Lanciers were but Tyſels growing upon a long high bank. And the two Armies being mixt, the French having the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, another Panick fear came amongſt the French Horſe,<note place="margin">Fear begets cruelty in effeminate Princes.</note> by a falſe rumor that the King was ſlain; that made them flee as if all had been loſt; and had not the King ſuddenly ſhewed himſelf, the French Army had utterly been routed. Secondly, Fear begets cruelty in the hearts of effeminate Princes; for it hath been obſerved that Puſillanimity is ever accompanied with Fear: The effeminate Emperors of <hi>Rome</hi> have all been addicted to this paſſion of Fear;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Tacitus, Dion, Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian <hi>and</hi> Suetonius.</note> 
                  <hi>Caligula</hi> did uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hide himſelf under a bed out of fear, when it Thundred and Lightned; and <hi>Nero, Domitianus, Commodus</hi> and <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus</hi> were afraid if men did but whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper together: and they were all more cruel then Tygers or Cannibals. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Fear hath no regard to conſanguinity; <hi>Tiberius Nero</hi> out of fear, deſtroyed by one means or other, all his neareſt kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,<note place="margin">See <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the Life of <hi>Nero.</hi>
                  </note> and cauſed the valorous and noble <hi>Germanicus</hi> his Nephew to be poyſoned
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:122164:142"/>by <hi>Piſo.</hi> And <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh King of <hi>France,</hi> cauſed his own Brother <hi>Charls</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> to be poyſoned out of Fear;<note place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>France</hi> and of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> and ſo did <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, his two hopeful Nephews: And out of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of State, or more properly out of Fear, The elder ſons of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, have for theſe many years cauſed their younger Brothers to be ſtrangled. Fourthly, Fear doth in admirable Effects go beyond Nature; for a Secretary of the State of <hi>Florence,</hi> being over night condemned to die, was ſo tranſported with the Fear of death, that out of the violent apprehenſion of it, the hair of his head and beard,<note place="margin">See the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</note> which was as black as a Crow, became before the morning as white as ſnow. Laſtly, Fear is the couſen german of diſpair; for it makes men to eſchew the ſhame of a publike death, to lay violent hands on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; For <hi>Hannibal</hi> rather then he would ſuffer to be made a publike ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of ſhame to the <hi>Romans,</hi> poyſoned himſelf: And Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> rather then he would loſe his head upon Tower-Hill, did the like, and died in <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Abbey.</p>
               <p>The good Effects of Fear may be
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:122164:142"/>theſe: Firſt,<note place="margin">Six good Effects of the Paſſion of Fear.</note> If it were not for the Fear of the puniſhments appointed by the Laws of the Land, to chaſtiſe the miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors of men, the Rodes and High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways would be ſo full of Thieves and Murtherers, that honeſt men ſhould not be able to go from one Town to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Secondly, If it were not for Fear, Laws and Magiſtrates would be tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under feet, and all manner of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Reverence, and reſpect would be baniſhed; <hi>Joane</hi> would be as good as my Lady, and <hi>Jack-Straw</hi> would be as good as my Lord Mayor; the Foot-man as good as his Lord, and the Servant as good as his Maſter; but Fear of correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on makes every one to give honor to whom honor is due, and to know his Rank and Degree. Thirdly, If it were not for Fear, raſh and timerary men would fix their hopes beyond the Stars, and would think nothing impoſſible unto them; but fear clips their wings, and makes them to be more conſiderate. Fourthly, Fear is the only Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the venome of preſumption; and were it not for Fear, this world could not ſubſiſt; for there never was an Age ſo full of <hi>Phaetons</hi> and <hi>Icarus</hi>'s as this, that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:122164:143"/>would with their waxed wings flee to Heaven, or burn the Earth by the guiding of <hi>Phoebus</hi> Chariot, if Fear did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them. Fifthly, Fear is the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Counſellor of great Politicians and Stateſ-men, who would otherwiſe vaunt themſelves (as the great Mathematician <hi>Archimedes</hi> did, to remove the World, or turn it up-ſide down, if he could finde out a ſolide Foundation to plant his Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Inſtruments) to ſet all the World together by the ears, to make their Prince the only Monarch of the Earth, by the means of their deep Machiavilian Policies: but Fear whiſpers them in the ear, that Policy hath ever been and ever ſhall be ſubordinate to Deſtiny, and that the ſecret Decrees of God ſhall come to paſs in deſpite of them, and will turn their Wiſdom and Policy into fooliſhneſs. Sixthly, As fear of temporal puniſhment is a Curbe to reſtrain open and groſs Sinners from criminal offences: ſo the Fear of eternal puniſhment is a ſtrong motive to withdraw civil men from their ſecret ſins; for let civil men be as private in their ſins as they can, yet the All-ſeeing Eye of God and their own Conſcience are witneſſes of their ſin; ſo
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:122164:143"/>that their Conſcience which is their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, doth infuſe into their minde this Fear of eternal puniſhment, whereby they are as much reſtrained from their ſecret ſins, as the groſs Sinners are by the Fear of temporal puniſhment. And as the hope of the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward doth draw many into the way of righteouſneſs; ſo the Fear of eternal puniſhment doth enforce many to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſin, and to turn unfainedly unto God; for Sinners muſt be firſt humbled and brought low by the terror of the Law, before they can unfainedly embrace the gracious Promiſes of the Goſpel: I do therefore conclude, that ſpiritual Fear joyned with ſpiritual hope, are effectual means to beget in Chriſtians a hunger and thirſt to obtain by the merits of Chriſt eternal life.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The ſpiritual Uſes of Fear may be theſe. 1. Men are not only to fear,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                  <note place="margin">The ſpiritual uſes of fear.</note> but alſo to love God; that their fear may not be a ſervile, but a filial fear; for the Divel himſelf fears and trembles at the very name of God; yet doth he not love, but hate and deteſt him. 2. Men are not only to fear to diſobey God, but they are alſo to endevor to do his will,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:122164:144"/>and to perform his commandements, that they may neither commit ſins of commiſſion, nor ſins of omiſſion; for it is not ſufficient for them to eſchew evill, but they muſt alſo endeavor to do good. 3. Men are not only to fear and to love God, but they are alſo to love, and to fear to offend their neighbors, that they may fulfill the ſecond Table as well as the firſt, and obſerve this precept of our bleſſed Saviour:<note place="margin">Math. 7.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them: for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi> 4. Men are not only to love and fear God, but they are alſo to love, fear, honor and reſpect his Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes or Deputies upon Earth; I mean the ſupream and ſubordinate Magiſtrates to whom he hath given the ſword of Juſtice in hand for to preſerve the Innocent, and to puniſh the wicked;<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.</note> 
                  <hi>For there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God.</hi> 5. Men cannot fear God, except they fear to commit ſin, becauſe there is nothing more odious to God then ſin; and ſuch as fear God, do hate and abhor ſin: for the fear of the Lord doth always precede the hatred of ſin, as it appears by this ſaying of <hi>Solomon,</hi>

                  <hi>Thou haſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>given me the heritage of thoſe that fear thy name;</hi> meaning, that ſuch as fear the Lord, have a moſt excellent Heritage, as it is by him confirmed by theſe words,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.6.</note> 
                  <hi>The lines are fallen unto me in pleaſant places; yea, I have a goodly Heritage.</hi> And in another place he ſaith, that God is the <hi>help and ſhield of thoſe who fear him.</hi> Again, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 115.11.</note>

                  <hi>but the days of the wicked ſhall be ſhortned:</hi> Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that ſuch as fear the Lord, have moſt excellent prerogatives. 6. The fear of the Lord is the rareſt jewel under the Sun; for King <hi>Solomon</hi> after he had ſhewn in his Book of recantations, that all things under the cope of Heaven were but meer vanity and vexation of ſpirit, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, That <hi>to fear God,</hi>

                  <hi>and to keep his Commandments, is the whole duty of man.</hi> And I conclude with him, that all fears whatſoever (except it be the fear of God, and the fear of ſin) are meer vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</p>

                  <p>Of the vanity of the paſsion of Wrath.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the former Ages of the World, They only were accounted generous, and of a maſculine courage, that could with patience endure all manner of injuries, and ſuffer with meekneſs all kinde of reproaches that were done or ſaid unto them, without being moved or diſtempered with this fiery paſſion of Wrath: as it may appear by theſe enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſtances that have been recorded by the Ancient Authors, in the praiſe and commendation of ſuch Princes and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe againſt Wrath.</note> that have been endowed with this rare vertue of Fortitude.

And this is one of the cauſes of all the Diviſions that reign in this Commonwealth. Give me leave therefore to enlarge my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon theſe particulars, to ſhew you the evil Nature, Proprieties, and Effects of this furious paſſion of Wrath.</p>

               <p>The Moraliſts do vary in their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, concerning the definition of this Paſſion; <hi>Senalt</hi> and others maintain it hath an oppoſite; but the Biſhop of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi> and <hi>Theophraſte Boujou</hi> Lord of <hi>Beaulien,</hi> in his Commentaries upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtoles</hi> Phyſicks maintains the contrary, to whoſe Works I refer the Reader for brevity ſake.

Anger is as it were the infancy of it, Choler its adoleſcencie, and Wrath its virility or maturity, and the higheſt and ſuperlative degree of the diſtemper of this fiery and deſtructive paſſion of Wrath.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The cauſes of Wrath are
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:122164:147"/>numerous; but I will reduce them to theſe four Heads.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To the Pride.</item>
                  <item>2. To the Impatiency.</item>
                  <item>3. To the indiſcretion.</item>
                  <item>4. To the over-credulity of men.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the firſt; It was Pride that moved <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> to ſlay in their wrath under colour of Piety and Religion, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> and <hi>Shechem,</hi> and all the innocent Males of their City, becauſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor they conceived to have received by the rape of their ſiſter <hi>Dinah:</hi> but the reward of their wrath was this heavy curſe of their Father <hi>Jacob; Curſed be their anger,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 34. v 25.497.</note> 
                  <hi>for it was fierce: and their wrath, for it was cruel; I will divide them in Jacob, and ſcatter them in Iſrael.</hi> And it was Pride that moved <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of Babylon, to command in his fierce wrath that <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach</hi> and <hi>Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego</hi> ſhould be caſt into a burning Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace heated ſeven times more then it was wont to be, becauſe they had refuſed to obey his imperious command: <hi>viz.</hi> to worſhip the golden Image he had cauſed to be ſet up. But the reward of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleld pride and wrath was this, that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:122164:147"/>he was depoſed of his Empire, driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the company of men, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to live amongſt the beaſts of the field, till he was humbled,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.20. and 4.32.</note> and did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that God was the King of Kings.</p>
               <p>For the Second; The ambitious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency of <hi>Joab</hi> moved him in his wrath to ſlay perfidiouſly <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa,</hi> that he might ſtill continue cheif General of the Armyes of the People of Iſrael: But the reward of his wrath and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was this, that king <hi>David</hi> at his dying hour charged <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſon that he ſhould not ſuffer <hi>Joabs</hi> hoary head to go down to the grave in peace.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 27. &amp; 20.10.</note> And the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural impatiency of <hi>Charls</hi> Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> was by Cuſtom changed into ſuch an habit of wrath, that upon the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt miſdemeanor of any of his ſervants, there was but a word and a blow: But the reward of his inconſiderate wrath was the cauſe he was betrayed and ſlayn at the rout of the Battle of <hi>Nancy</hi> by a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Commander,<note place="margin">See <hi>Philip de Commines</hi> in his life.</note> to whom he had given a box on the ear.</p>
               <p>For the Third; The indiſcretion of <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and of <hi>Calliſthenes,</hi> two intimate freinds of <hi>Alexander,</hi> in their out-brai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:122164:148"/>ſpeeches,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> life.</note> moved this Prince to ſuch a wrath that he ſlew them with his own hands. And the indiſcreet and unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed anſwer that <hi>Zeno</hi> gave to <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> when he loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required he ſhould give unto him his two Daughters in marriage, <hi>viz.</hi> that he would rather ſee them carried to their graves, then they ſhould be married to ſuch a Tyrant;<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</note> did kindle ſuch a wrath in the heart of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> that he cauſed thoſe two innocent Ladyes to be ſlayn, and then invited their Father to their Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.</p>
               <p>For the Fourth; The over-credulity of King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> in believing the falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that <hi>Haman</hi> his Favorite made unto him againſt the Jews, kindled ſuch a wrath in his breſt,<note place="margin">Eſth. 3.8.</note> that he cauſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently a Decree to be paſſed for the utter deſtruction of all the Jews that were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered throughout the hundred and ſeven and twenty Provinces of his Dominions. And the over-credulity of the good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Theodoſius</hi> in believing the falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of ſome of his Courtiers concerning an uprore and mutiny that had happened in the City of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hiſtories.</note> did beget ſuch a wrath in this good Princes heart,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:122164:148"/>that he inſtantly paſſed a Decree that all the Inhabitants of that City, both men, women and children ſhould be put to the ſword: But after this Decree had been put in execution, he was truly informed that very few had a hand in this mutiny: for which inconſiderate wrath of his he was much afflicted and penitent all the days of his life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Proprieties of Wrath are theſe: 1. It is of an ayrie &amp; fiery quality,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as proceeding, as I have ſaid before, of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing of the gall, the ſeat of the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Choler; &amp; therefore it muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be fiery, ſith the cholerick humor is compared to the fiery Element; and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience doth ſhew, that bilious complexioned men are moſt addicted to Anger, Choler, and Wrath.<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of Wrath.</note> It is alſo of an ayrie quality, becauſe the mixture of the bloud, which is compared to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Ayr, maketh the ſame as light and ſwift as the Ayr. 2. Wrath is of a ſpreading and dilative quality, for as a ſmall piece of Leven doth dilate it ſelf in a ſhort time thorow a great lump of dow, and make the ſame riſe and ſwell; ſo this cholerick humor mixt with the bloud, dilates it ſelf thorow all the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:122164:149"/>parts of the body, and inflames them all with Anger and Wrath. 3. Wrath hath a changing or altering quality; for it changeth the coulor of the Face, ſets the eyes on fire, and makes the members of ſome mens bodies to tremble like a leaf. Again, in ſome other men, it will make their Face as white as a Clout, their Tongues to ſtammer, and their Eyes to roll in their Heads; all which ſymptoms and qualities do confirm the violent fury of this paſſion. And that is the reaſon why it is compared to the flaſhof Gun-powder, or to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyling of a Pot. 4. Wrath oppoſed and hindered to vent it ſelf, doth in time turn into an inveterate hatred, or at the beſt into a deep and incurable ſorrow; and ſometimes it induceth men to deſpair and to lay violent hands upon themſelves when they cannot be revenged to their mindes upon their enemies.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The evill effects of Wrath are as deſtructive as the proprieties of it are precipitate.<note place="margin">The perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effects of Wrath.</note> 1. The virulency of this paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſo pernicious that it blemiſheth the graces of Gods deareſt Children, and extinguiſheth all moral vertues in civil and moral men: Nay, it deprives them
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:122164:149"/>of reaſon and judgement, and makes them go aſtray from Juſtice and equity. King <hi>David</hi> was a man after Gods own heart; yet by the means of this paſſion he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a great injuſtice, in ſuffering the falſe Accuſator <hi>Ziba</hi> to have half the land of the Innocent <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> as it appears by this unjuſt ſentence;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> 27, 29.</note> 
                  <hi>And the king ſayd unto him, why ſpeakeſt thou any more of this matter? I have ſaid, Thou and</hi> Ziba <hi>divide the Land.</hi> 2. Wrath begets contention and ſtrife betwixt the cheifeſt veſſels of grace; for it wrought ſuch a contention between S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that it made <hi>Paul</hi> to aſſociate himſelf with <hi>Silas;</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> with <hi>Mark;</hi> and ſo divided one from the other theſe two famous Inſtruments of the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the glory of God. 3. Wrath enticeth men to cruelty, and is often the cauſe of the ruine and deſolation of great and Populous Cities. The Emperor <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> was ſo tranſported with wrath by an Affront done by the People of <hi>Milan</hi> to the Empreſſe his wife, that he cauſed his Army to ſack the City of <hi>Milan,</hi> and to put all the Inhabitants of it to the Sword,<note place="margin">See the Fc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical hiſtory.</note> and afterwards to burn the ſame to the ground. And the Duke <hi>Charls</hi> of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:122164:150"/>
                  <hi>Burgundy</hi> moved to wrath by an injury done to himſelf by the Citizens of <hi>Dinan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

When men are tranſported with Wrath, they have no regard to Father, Mother nor Brethren.<note place="margin">Gen. 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew his Brother <hi>Abel; Nero</hi> his Mother; and <hi>Selymus</hi> poyſoned his Father, out of wrath proceeding from ambition: So that Wrath is the cauſe of much Blooſhed, and unparalleld Evils, Miſeries and Deſolations.</p>
               <p>The good effects of Wrath are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It makes Cowards to become va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant;<note place="margin">The good Effects of Wrath.</note> for the greateſt Coward in the World being tranſported with Wrath, becomes as bold as a Lyon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wrath inciteth Chriſtians to a Godly Indignation, when they ſee the Worſhip and Glory of God abuſed; and this is the onely commendable effect of Wrath: for the which, <hi>Phineas</hi> the Son of <hi>Eleazar,</hi> the Son of <hi>Aaron</hi> the high Prieſt, obtained this following Bleſſing of the Lord for having ſlain <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozbi</hi> in his wrath, proceeding from a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Zeal to Gods glory; Wherefore the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:122164:150"/>Lord ſaid, <hi>Behold I give unto him my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Peace; And he ſhall have it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 25.12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>and his Seed after him; even the Covenant of an everlaſting Preiſthood: becauſe he was zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for his God, and made an attonement for the children of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The moderate Anger and Wrath of Parents towards their Children; and of Maſters towards their Servants, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes of great uſe to keep them in due obedience, and to make them more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the performance of their duty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Wrath of God is of great uſe to bring Impenitent Sinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For when they hear that <hi>his Wrath burns like fire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 89.46.</note> and that it is like a whirlwind which turneth upſide down the higheſt mountains, it makes them put their hands upon their breſts, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with the <hi>penitent Publican,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 18.10.</note> that they are not worthy to look up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And I am perſwaded, conſidering the perverſe inclinations of men, that more are converted by the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Wrath, then by the gracious invitations of his Love are Promiſes; yet happy and bleſſed are they who are drawn near him by his incomprehenſible Love in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> towards them: and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:122164:151"/>that fear more to diſpleaſe him out of a ſincere and filial Love unto him, then out of a ſervile apprehenſion of his Wrath.</p>
               <p>To conclude, it appears by the Nature, Proprieties, and Effects of Wrath, that it is a paſſion above all others that men ſhould moſt endevor to ſubdue and keep ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to Reaſon. And to that end ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe enſuing Remedies that are to be uſed to hinder this ſtubborn Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to obtain the Maſtery over Men.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Remedies to curb and keep under ſubjection this ragefull and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Paſſion of Wrath, may be reduced to theſe Four heads:
<list>
                     <item>1.<note place="margin">Four Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies againſt the venom of Wrath.</note> Humility.</item>
                     <item>2. Patience.</item>
                     <item>3. Prudence.</item>
                     <item>4. Charity.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For the Firſt; Humility is an excellent Remedy to aſſwage the fiery rage of Wrath;<note place="margin">Prov. 15.1.</note> For as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>A ſoft An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer turneth away Wrath; but grievous words ſtir up Anger:</hi> And as fire goeth out of it ſelf if it be not nouriſhed by ſome Combuſtible matter: ſo Wrath will va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh into ſmoak, if it be not fomented and encreaſed by ill Language, or by inſolent Poſtures and Miſdemeanors. <hi>Abigail</hi> by
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:122164:151"/>her humble geſture, and gentle ſpeech, did ſuddenly pacify the fiery Wrath of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> that had been kindled by the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs of <hi>Nabal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.22, 24.</note> and prevented the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the raſh Decree that <hi>David</hi> had pronounced againſt <hi>Nabal</hi> and all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Nay, Humility is ſo powerfull and acceptable to God, that it is able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe his Wrath, as it appears by Gods gracious and mercifull Carriage towards King <hi>David</hi> himſelf after the commiſſion of the two abhorred ſins of Adultery and Murder: for he had no ſooner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his ſin with an unfained Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.13.</note> but God was pleaſed to pardon him the guilt, although he inflicted a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Puniſhment upon his Family for it.</p>
               <p>For the Second; Patience is an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Remedy to appeaſe the rage of Wrath: as it appears by the Counſel that <hi>Athenodorus</hi> gave to his Pupill <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> whom he knew naturally addicted to Wrath. At the firſt motion of this Paſſion, ſaid he to him,<note place="margin">See <hi>Sueton.</hi> in <hi>Auguſt.</hi> life.</note> You muſt ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to cruſh this Cockatrice in the ſhell: but if it cannot be, break the fury of it by Patience: And before you decree any thing in your Anger, count upon your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ends the four and twenty Letters of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:122164:152"/>the Greek Alphabet: For by this ſmall intermiſſion of time your Reaſon and Judgement will come to it ſelf again, that hath been perverted by the fury of this Paſſion of Wrath. It is Recorded that <hi>Plato</hi> upon the Relation of an unpleaſant Meſſage was ſomething moved with Wrath: whereupon he roſe from his ſeat to fetch his ſtaff: But another Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſeeing it, ſaid unto him, It is unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for you <hi>Plato</hi> to be thus moved with Wrath as to fetch your ſtaff to beat a Meſſenger;<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch.</hi> in his Mor.</note> You are deceived, ſaid he: It was to burb and beat mine own Wrath that began to be Maſter over my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; Prudence is a ſoveraign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt Wrath: For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that is ſlow to Wrath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 14.28.</note> 
                  <hi>is of great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: but he that is haſty of ſpirit, exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth folly.</hi> Whereby it appears, that ſuch as are apt to be tranſported with immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Wrath, are like fools or mad men: and that there is none truly wiſe but ſuch as can pacify their Wrath. And that was the reaſon why <hi>Socrates</hi> was judged by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> to be the wiſeſt man of all the Greeks,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutar</hi> in his Mor. in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe againſt Wrath.</note> becauſe he could not be moved to Wrath: for had not he been
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:122164:152"/>patient and prudent, he and his wife had lived like dogs and cats: but he with an admirable patience did bear with her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and waywardneſs. It is Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cynick being told that the <hi>Athenians</hi> jeered him for his ruſtical and uncivil deportments: let them jeer ſaith he, for they may doe it long enough before they can caſt me into a Paſſion of Wrath.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; Charity is a moſt excellent Remedy againſt Wrath:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.7.</note> for as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Charity beareth all things, belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things:</hi> ſo if men be endowed with this Superlative Grace of Charity, they will not be moved nor tranſported with Wrath againſt their Brethren: But the want of Charity one towards another is the Cauſe that men are filled with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, Envy and Wrath. For <hi>Charity ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth long, and is kinde: Charity envyeth not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Charity vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly, thinketh no evil: Rejoyceth not in iniquity, but rejoyceth in the truth.</hi> Theſe are the noble and gracious Effects of Charity; which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets out ſo fully and elegantly, to make men in love with Charity, as the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:122164:153"/>cheifeſt of all Spiritual Graces, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the laſt Verſe of this Chapter, <hi>And now abideth Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Hope, Charity, theſe Three, but the greateſt of Theſe is Charity.</hi> Men therefore ſhould earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endevor to obtain of God by fervent prayers this excellent Grace of Charity; For without it all other Graces are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life, and of no validity, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth witneſs the ſame from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Chapter to the latter end. And I am verily perſwaded that the want of Charity is the cauſe of all the Diviſions and Contentions that reign in this Commonwealth, and why men are ſo apt to Vindication and Wrath; Which the Heathen Philoſophers did abhor and deteſt as the moſt ragefull and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Paſſion of all others, fitter for brute and cruel beaſts, as Lyons and Tygers, then for Rational men, and ſpecially for Chriſtians, who have before their eys for a ſpecial Preſident the admirable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and unparalleld Meekneſs of our Bleſſed Saviour, to make them hate and deteſt Anger, Choler and Wrath; for the Lord (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>) <hi>hath layd on him the iniquities of us all;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſal. 53.6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>He was oppreſſed, and he was afflicted: yet he opened
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:122164:153"/>not his mouth. He is brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a Sheep before her Shea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer is dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth.</hi> The Event, Iſſue and Accompliſhment of this Propheſy is clearly expreſſed in the 27. Chapter of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where you may ſee how the Jews ſpit in his face, ſet a crown of thorns upon his head, put upon him a ſcarlet robe, and gave him a reed in his right hand, and in deriſion bowed the knee before him, <hi>and mocked him, ſaying,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 27.28, 29, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Hail king of the Jews.</hi> And yet for all theſe injuries, ſhameful reproaches, and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld ignominies, he never opened his mouth to give them a bad word: far from being poſſeſſed with the leaſt appearance or motion of Anger, Choler and Wrath. This Example ſhould induce Chriſtians to abhor and eſchew this vile Paſſion of Wrath more then the Contagious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe of the Plague. It appears then by this Diſcourſe, that Wrath is not only vanity, but an extream vexation of ſpirit.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the vanity of the paſsion of Volupty.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving thus deſcribed the Nature, Proprieties, and Effects of the eleven general Paſſions of men: I now come to ſpeak of ſome of the mixt, or compoſed: And will give the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminency to Volupty, Avarice, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, as the moſt predominant Paſſions of this Age: For although I have given a hint of them in the ſecond, third, and fourth Chapters of this Treatiſe, under the notion of the pleaſures, riches, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of this life; yet I conceive it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to ſpeak of them more fully in this place; for if men would but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to allay the fury of theſe three Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; the boiſtrous ſtorms of our Civil Diſtractions would ſuddenly be changed into a calm of Peace; Sith the diſtemper of them hath ever been from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Creation to this day; the chiefeſt Incendiary of all the Civil broils and mutations which have happened in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:122164:155"/>the World, as it will appear in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of their pernitious Effects.</p>
               <p>There are divers ſorts of Volupties; yet they may be reduced under theſe three heads:
<list>
                     <item>1. The Spiritual.</item>
                     <item>2. The Natural.</item>
                     <item>3. The Carnal.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is ſuper-excellent, the ſecond harmleſs, the third ſinful.</p>
               <p>The Spiritual proceeds from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the Saints take in the hearing of Gods Word, and in the meditating in his<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 1.2.</note> Law day and night: And in their prayers and other exerciſes of religious duties, or in the contemplation of the admirable works of the Creation; and how they have been preſerved in their firſt being for ſo many years together, by his Wiſdom and Divine Providence: But ſpecially in the conſideration of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible love of God towards mankinde, manifeſted by the ſending of his only beloved Son into the World to redeem his Elect from eternal death.</p>
               <p>The Natural proceeds from a delight men take when they eat, being hungry, when they drink, when they are athirſt,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:122164:155"/>ſleep, when they have watched, and reſt when they are weary; and from divers other ſuch refreſhments of Nature.</p>
               <p>The Carnal proceeds from a tickling delight of the five ſenſes; for every one of them have their peculiar volupty, as it appears by the proprieties of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans: The Eyes take delight in beautiful objects, the Ears in melody, the Noſe in odoriferous odors, the Pallate in delitious Wines, and the Members in wanton feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Now when any of theſe delights of the ſenſes becomes diſordinate, it is called a carnal volupty, whereby it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that our five ſenſes are the original ſprings of all carnal volupties, which are innumerable. But the volupty I intend to ſpeak of, is a mixt delight, compoſed of two of the moſt laſcivious ſenſes, <hi>viz.</hi> of the ſeeing and feeling, called luſt or lechery: And by conſequence the moſt ſinful of any, if it be refractory to the Rules ſet down in the Word of God: This paſſion is more pleaſant then any other to our corrupt nature; for delight is the darling of nature, and dolour her mortal enemies; and the more pleaſing it is to the fleſh, the harder it is to overcome, <hi>For the fleſh,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul, luſteth againſt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:122164:156"/>the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh;</hi> and as theſe are contrary one to another, ſo are their operations: For <hi>the fruits of the Spirit, are joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, goodneſs, faith, holineſs, &amp;c.</hi> But the works of the fleſh, <hi>are adulteries, fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and uncleaneſs, &amp;c.</hi> This Antipathy ſhould then move Chriſtians to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to overcome this paſſion as the greateſt Antagoniſt againſt the grace of ſanctification; for if it getteth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery over their reaſon, it will deprive them of their love and filial fear, and tempt them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.15.</note> 
                  <hi>To make of the members of Chriſt, the members of a Harlot.</hi> It is alſo one of the moſt prevailing ſnares of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, by which he draweth more millions of ſouls into the Pit of deſtruction then by any other ſin whatſoever: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give me leave to enlarge my ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe particulars:
<list>

                     <item>7. Upon the means or remedies which are to be uſed to avoid the venome of it.</item>
                     <item>8. And laſtly, Upon the expreſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of the ſame by the Word of God.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Volupty is a compoſed paſſion of love and deſire,<note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Volupty.</note> ariſing from a tickling delight of the ſenſes when men enjoy really, or by imagination, ſuch objects as ſeem pleaſant to their phanſie. It is ſo general, that all ſuch as are under the ſtate of Nature, are more or leſs addicted to it: Nay, the regenerate are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times enſnared by it, by the temptations of Satan and their original corruptions; the difference between them, is, that the unregenerate by their impenitency die in their ſins, and the regenerate by the free grace of the ſanctifying Spirit of God, are awaked out of this ſpiritual lethargy, and by an unfained repentance are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and reconciled to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is of a feminine nature; for all ſuch as are overmuch addicted to this paſſion, looſe their maſculine gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, and become effeminate: <hi>Hercules</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:122164:157"/>did caſt off his Club and Lyons skin, to veſt himſelf and ſpin like a woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Omphale</hi> his Miſtreſs. And it is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen that voluptuous men imitate in their geſtures, carriage and faſhions, the Courtizans of theſe days; for they pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their hair, wear black patches, and paint their Faces as they do. It was not then without cauſe, that the ancient Poets did repreſent volupty under the ſhape of the old Witch <hi>Circe;</hi> for as ſhe transformed the Paſſengers who ſailed through the Straits of <hi>Sicilia</hi> into Swine if they liſtned to her Charms: Even ſo Volupty doth transform into brute beaſts rational men, if they converſe long, and let themſelves be enſnared by the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Charms of Harlots; for as <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balel</hi> proved it before King <hi>Darius,</hi> the Charms of a beautiful woman are more powerful then ſtrong Wine,<note place="margin">Eſdras 3. from the 14. ver. to the 32.</note> or a mighty King.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Cauſes why ſome men are more addicted to this paſſion then others, may be natural, accidental, or arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial: ſuch as are naturally more addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to it, are commonly of a hotter and moiſter conſtitution then others, and theſe are of a ſanguine complexion; for
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:122164:157"/>the Bilious are hot and dry, the Flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick moiſt and cold, and the Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like cold and dry, which are not ſo apt to the Venereal delight as the Sanguine. The Accidental Cauſes are, The hot Climate where men live: for Heat dilates the ſpirits outwardly, and Cold reſtrains them inwardly. And Experience doth ſhew that the Africans, Spaniards, and Italians, whoſe Climate is hotter then the Germans, Dutch &amp; Engliſh, are the moſt addicted to Venery. And yet they are not ſo apt to generation as the laſt: becauſe the deſire of the reiteration of the Act doth weaken their bodies, and doth waſte their ſpirits. Idleneſs, Pride and Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of bread is alſo an Accidental Cauſe why one Nation may be more addicted to Venery then another. For this was the Cauſe why the <hi>Sodomites</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaith) were ſo vitious,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.49.</note> and tranſported with Luſt. The Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Cauſes are, Sophiſtical meats; Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Wines, and enticing Simples, Drugs and Amber-gris over-much u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in theſe days to provoke Men and Women to Luſt.<note place="margin">See <hi>Guicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardine</hi> in the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth his Life.</note> 
                  <hi>Guicciardine</hi> records, that a King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> being at <hi>Naples,</hi> ſpent five hundred Ducats in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:122164:158"/>Drugs and Amber-gris to dreſs a Peacock, to incite himſelf and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that ſupped with him that night to Luſt. But theſe Means are deſtructive to the Soul and Lives of Men. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Queen of <hi>Arragon</hi> gave <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> her Husband an inticing Love-Drink to make him more apt to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal ſport,<note place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nands</hi> Life.</note> but it caſt him into an incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſumption, which brought him to his grave. And <hi>Van-Dick</hi> an excellent Dutch Painter, loſt lately his life by theſe inticing Drugs provoking to Lechery. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs; Men are too prone of themſelves to ſin without Artificial Means to provoke them to it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The evil Proprieties of this vitious Paſſion are ſo numerous, that I ſhould be over-tedious to ſpeak of them all: and therefore will ſpeak but of ſome of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is inſatiable; and may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the horſleech, to the barren womb, and to the Grave; for the Deſires of Voluptuous men are never ſatisfied with their carnal Delights, their bodies being ſooner tyred with the reiteration of the Act, then their Luſt can be exſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. For many have been found dead in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:122164:158"/>their Miſtreſſes Armes, by endeavoring to ſatisfy their Luſt beyond their Natural Abilities. The Reaſon of it was, becauſe overmuch evacuation of the ſpirits ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is as inconſtant as the wind; for they delight in nothing more then in changes, becauſe their judgement is ſo depraved by the Spirit of uncleanneſs which beſots them, that they cannot diſcern the beauty of one Object from another, and do often forſake the moſt lovely, to dote upon the moſt unworthy and deformed: conceiving erroneouſly, that ſtollen waters are the ſweeteſt.</p>

It deprives men of all true content, and over-whelms them with grief and ſorrows: for in what condition ſoever voluptuous men finde themſelves, they neither take pleaſure nor content, except their minde be alwayes bent upon the means that can make them attain to the fruition of their carnal delights; for in them they erroneouſly conceive doth
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:122164:161"/>conſiſt their ſupream felicity: whereas the termination of the pleaſures of the fleſh, is ever the beginning of miſery and wo: And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to diſſwade his Diſciples from carnal volupties, told them that they were like the Mer-maids, who are extraordinarily beautiful above water, for their face is round and fair, their hair as yellow as gold, their eyes of a loving dark gray, their mouth ſmall, their lips as red as Coral, their teeth as white as ſnow, their breaſt as round as an apple, and their arms, hands, ſhoulders, back, flanks as white as Alabaſter, but their tail is like the tail of a great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, frightful, full of teeth, and mortal venom: Even ſo carnal volupties are delightful to mens corrupt nature, and ſeem to be ſweeter then honey and the honey comb at the firſt enjoyment of them; but at their adieu, they are bitterer then gall, and more loathſome then the ſnuff of a candle, and for one dram of carnal delight: they over-whelm their Clients with anguiſh and ſorrow, and make them ſhed rivers of penitent tears, whenſoever God is pleaſed to give them the gift of an unfained repentance. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, all true joy and content doth conſiſt
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:122164:161"/>in the favour and love of God, and in the aſſurance he doth infuſe in the hearts of his Elect by his bleſſed Spirit, that they are juſtified and reconciled unto him by the ſufferings, blood, and paſſion of Chriſt his only Son our moſt gracious Saviour; and this love, favour, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is permanent and eternal; but the joy and content proceeding from carnal volupties, are for continuance like a fire of Thorns under a Pot, or like the morning dew which vaniſheth away at the riſing of the Sun; for the leaſt blaſt of dolor and affliction doth ſuddenly make the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remembrance of carnal pleaſures va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh away like ſmoak; moreover, the very conceits, imaginations, and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of voluptuous men are meer vanity and vexation of minde; for their paradiſe upon Earth is to be always muſing upon the beauty, comlineſs and perfections of their Miſtreſs: Nay, ſome are ſo infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſpirit of uncleanneſs which doth poſſeſs them, that they do Idolize their picture, kiſs their dreſſings, and other things they wear, nay the very ground they tread upon: And can there be any real content in theſe abſurd vanities, mad and fooliſh deportments? ſurely no:

It deprives men of their means; for Princes, Noble-men, Gentlemen, Merchants, and Artificers, who are given to volupties, do commonly fall into pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury; for as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>By the means of a whoriſh woman, a man is brought to a piece of bread.</hi> I will prove the point by Inſtances. 1. All the Treaſures of <hi>Aſia</hi> did not ſuffice to defray the exceſſive vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lupties of <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> 2.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:122164:162"/>Subjects. 4. Daily experience doth ſhew that many Noble-men, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and rich Merchants, ſpend and conſume their Portion or Patrimony as the Prodigal Son did with Harlots and riotous living. 5.<note place="margin">Luk. 15.13.</note> It ſhortneth mens days and makes their lives miſerable; for none can deny but continency, temperance, and ſobriety doth preſerve men in health and doth prolong their lives.

And what vexation is it unto him to ſee Wife, neareſt Parents, and intimate friends to eſchew the very ſight of him, and forſake him in theſe anxieties? Oh what inward torments doth he feel by the gnawing worm of an awakned conſcience which doth rack him day and night, by the horrid repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of his former pollutions?

But 6. it endangers alſo their ſouls, for if they continue in their impenitency till the end of their days, they run a hazard, without the ſpecial mercy of God, to be deprived for ever of his gracious preſence; For S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative ſenſe,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.4.</note>

               <p>Firſt, Idleneſs is to be eſchewed, for if mens minds be not bent upon laudable employments, they will buſie themſelves in unlawful things, becauſe their ſpirits are naturally active: And as ſtanding waters become loathſome, even ſo men who have no employment become viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:122164:167"/>And daily experience ſheweth, that ſuch as are rich and have no calling, are more addicted to Volupties then the meaner ſort.

               <p>Fourthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> All evil Company is to be eſchewed; for in them lyeth an inſenſible venom; the Effects of which do not appear ſuddenly; but in continuance of time it will ſhew it ſelf viſibly in the life and converſation of men and women; for young men that fall into evil company, will at the firſt be aſhamed of it; but after they have frequented them, they wil delight in it, then they will palliate and excuſe them; and laſtly, they will
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:122164:169"/>patronize and maintain them: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as vitious, profane, and debaucht as the worſt of them; and therefore as he that toucheth Pitch ſhall be defiled with it:<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 13.1.</note> even ſo ſuch as haunt evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, will at laſt be infected with their vices: Beſides, it is a diſhonour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with evil company; for if men were as righteous as <hi>Lot, Who was,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi>

               <p>Firſt, men are to endeavor by fervent prayers to obtain from God the Grace of Continency, which is diſtinguiſhed by corporeal and intellectual; the firſt is common to natural men as well as to the children of God; but the ſecond is onely peculiar to the true Elect, becauſe it is an immediate gift of the ſanctifying Spirit of Grace, to ſuch as are regenerated by a juſtifying Faith, for by Faith men are juſtified, and afterwards ſanctified: for all things which are done without Faith,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:122164:170"/>cannot,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> be acceptable unto God; contrarily they are an abomination unto him. The Heathens have excelled in the corporeal continency, moſt of the Chriſtians of theſe days, as it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the carriage of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great towards the two Daughters of King <hi>Darius;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi> in their lives.</note> and of <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> towards a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady that was his Captive; but none of them could ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the intellectual continency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were out of the Covenant of Grace: and by conſequence incapable of a juſtifying Faith: And among thoſe who were under the Convenant of Grace, the number was ſmall that were truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, or had the gift of the corporeal and intellectual continency, except it were <hi>Iſaac, Joſeph,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> for all the other Patriarks were addicted to Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy. The corporeal continency may proceed from natural cauſes, as from a defect of Nature, as the Eunuchs, or it may be obtained by the precepts of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and a good education; But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual cannot be acquired, becauſe it is a ſupernatural Grace of the ſanctifying Spirit, except it be by frequent and fervent prayers to God, who is the only
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:122164:170"/>giver of it: And certainly by the want of this Grace of intellectual continency, many of the moſt precious Chriſtians of theſe days commit Adultery in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation with their own Wives; of which they ſeldom repent. Which doth induce me to enlarge my ſelf upon this point. Chriſt our bleſſed Saviour, who was the beſt Interpreter of the Law that ever was upon Earth, doth tell us plainly,<note place="margin">Math. 5.18.</note> 
                  <hi>That whoſoever looketh upon a woman to luſt after her, hath committed Adultery with her already in his heart.</hi> Now this luſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the eyes;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.17.</note> 
                  <hi>and the luſt of the eyes,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>John, is not of the Father, but of the world,</hi> and the eyes convey the ſame into the heart; and from the heart, ſaith our Saviour, proceed <hi>evil thoughts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 15.19.</note> 
                  <hi>murthers, adulteries, fornications,</hi> &amp;c. So many looking upon a woman with laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious eyes, make ſuch an impreſſion in their imagination of her beauty or come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which is ſuggeſted to their phanſie by their ſenſes and the temptations of Satan, to excel the beauty or comelineſs of their Wives, that in the very cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with them, their mind is wholly bent upon this forraign object, and not upon the ſame they embrace; and this
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:122164:171"/>is a plain intellectual Adultery of the heart, committed in the Matrimonial Bed, which is as odious to God (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not cenſurable by men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is inviſible) as the actual Adultery with a ſtrange woman. This ſhould move all true Chriſtians, who through a filial fear are timerous to offend God, to be cautious of their ways, that they be not enſnared by their deceitful hearts, and the temptations of Satan in this kinde of Adultery: or if they be, that they may unfainedly repent of it before death part their ſoul from their body, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe without the ſpecial mercies of God, their ſouls may run as much hazard by this ſort of Adultery, as by the actual.</p>
               <p>Secondly, men are to endevor to attain to an habit in Temperance and Sobriety, vertues or graces oppoſite to the vices of gluttony &amp; drunkenneſs, two of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt provokers to Luſt. Theſe are alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by corporeal and Intellectual.</p>
               <p>The corporal Temperance may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Moral Precepts, but the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual is an immediate gift of the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Spirit of grace, and cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but by Prayer; for God is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giver of it: And it is properly called
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:122164:171"/>Meekneſs of ſpirit, and the inſeparable companion of the grace of ſanctification; The proprieties and effects of which are apparently ſeen in the carriage and replies of <hi>Job, Moſes, Ely, David,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> 1. When the Meſſengers came ſuddenly after one another to acquaint <hi>Job</hi> of the loſs of all he had, and of the death of his Children: he replyed with an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable meekneſs of ſpirit,<note place="margin">Job. 1.21.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken: bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> 2. <hi>Moſes</hi> with the like meekneſs did patiently endure the falſe and offenſive reproaches of his own brother and ſiſter,<note place="margin">Numb. 12.3.</note> for the which he is called by the Holy Ghoſt <hi>the meekeſt man upon earth.</hi> 3. <hi>Eli</hi> with the ſame meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit anſwered the Prophet <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> when hd had acquainted him of the will of the Lord,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.18.</note> concerning the death of his two ſons, and the caſting off of his Poſterity from the High-Prieſts office; <hi>it is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth good unto him.</hi> 4. When King <hi>David</hi> heard the bitter Curſes of <hi>Shimei,</hi> for the which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhai</hi> would have ſlain him, he anſwered with the like meckneſs of ſpirit,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Let him curſe, becauſe the Lord hath ſayd unto him, curſe</hi> David; <hi>who ſhal then ſay, Wherefore haſt
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:122164:172"/>thou done ſo?</hi> 5. When the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ſent to King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to denounce the heavy judgement of God againſt <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> and his poſterity, he anſwered with the like meekneſs of ſpirit,<note place="margin">Iſal 39.8.</note> 
                  <hi>The word of the Lord is good which thou haſt ſpoken.</hi> Whereby it appears that the temperance of the minde is a great curb to bridle the violence of the Paſſions of men: for the Anſwer that <hi>Joſeph gave</hi> to his lewd Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs when ſhe tempted him to lie with her, did proceed from the ſame root, and from the filial fear he had of God:<note place="margin">Gen. 39.8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold my Maſter knoweth not what he hath in the houſe: but hath committed all he hath into my hands: there is none greater in the houſe then I: neither hath he kept any thing from mee but only thee, becauſe thou art his wife: How then can I do this great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſo ſin againſt God?</hi> But ſuch is the depravation of this age, that I have heard ſome Voluptuous men call continent <hi>Joſeph</hi> a very Sot, for having rejected the laſcivious Summons of his Miſtreſs, and neglected through a Puerile Fear, the Time, Place and Opportunity to enjoy the pleaſures of her embracements. As for the Corporeal Temperance and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety; the Heathens have alſo excelled
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:122164:172"/>moſt of the Chriſtians of theſe days in that noble vertue, as it ſhall appear by theſe Inſtances. 1. King <hi>Cyrus</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his Steward, Where and What he pleaſed to have for his Supper, Anſwered, <hi>I will ſup by the River-ſide, and have only for my Diet Bread and Salt: for Drink we ſhall have enough out of the River.</hi> 2. The Queen of <hi>Caria</hi> having ſent to <hi>Alexander</hi> the rareſt Cooks that were in <hi>Aſia,</hi> he ſent them back unto her, with this Meſſage, that <hi>he had no need of Cooks as long as he did obſerve the Precepts of his Tutor</hi> Leonides, <hi>who had charged him to exerciſe his body in the Morning in running of Races on foot, or in the mannaging of his War horſe, to give him a ſtomack to his Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: and to walk two or three miles in the Evening, to have an Appetite to his Supper.</hi> 3. <hi>Phocion,</hi> one of the Governors of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Commonwealth, was found at Dinner (by the Embaſſador that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> ſent to him with a Preſent of ten Talents) with one ſingle diſh of meat;<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Life.</note> and having demanded of the Embaſſador the reaſon why <hi>Alexander</hi> did ſend him ſuch a Preſent; he anſwered, Only for your integrity &amp; vertue; Let him leave me ſo, ſaid <hi>Phocion,</hi> for this Gold will make
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:122164:173"/>me unjuſt and vitious, and ſo with thanks ſent the preſent back to <hi>Alexander.</hi> 4. <hi>Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Livy</hi> in his 1. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade.</note> Dictator of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth, was found at Dinner with a ſmall piece of meat and a diſh of Turnips, by the Embaſſadors of the <hi>Samnites</hi> that were ſent unto him with a great ſum of Gold, to induce him to ſhew them favor in the obtaining of a Peace which they required of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate: Whereupon <hi>Cincinnatus</hi> ſhewing them the frugality of his Diet, ſaid unto them, Tell the <hi>Samnites,</hi> that he that can be contented with ſuch Fare, needs no Gold; and therefore carry it back; for if their requeſt be juſt, they ſhall have my favor without it. There are evidences of the Temperance of the ancient <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> concerning the paſſions of Avarice and Volupty. But as ſoon as the <hi>Perſians</hi> by <hi>Cambiſes,</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> by <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> by <hi>Lucullus</hi> were allured to deſire riches and pleaſures,<note place="margin">See <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſes</hi> Life.</note> they became the moſt covetous and voluptuous Nations of the World: and all their former Vertues were turned into Vices: Therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that Temperance and Sobriety are the inſeparable companions of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:122164:173"/>and ſanctification: And that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Gluttony and Drunkneſs are the greateſt Provokers to luſt and carnal Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lupties: And this Paſſage of <hi>S. Paul</hi> doth confirm the ſame, <hi>They that ſleep,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5 7, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>ſleep in the night: and they that are drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en are drunken in the night. But let us which are of the day be ſober. Therefore let us not ſleep, but let us watch and be ſober.</hi> Intimating that none are more fit to attain to holyneſs then thoſe who are temperate and ſober: And none more adverſe then drunkards and voluptuous men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, men are to endevor to attain to an habit in Fortitude, called by ſome a vertue; but when it is accompanied with Faith, it is a grace of the ſanctifying Spirit. 1. By it <hi>Shadrach,</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, men are to endevor to attain an habit in the grace of Sanctification, as the Seal of their Juſtification and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and Redemption; And the onely way to obtain the ſame, is by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent prayers and dayly exerciſes in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties: having ever in their mind theſe Paſſages of Scripture,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.14.</note> 
                  <hi>For without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>

                  <hi>and the faith of truth. And that you ſhould abſtain from fornication: that every one of you ſhould know how to poſſeſs his veſſel in holineſs and honor; and not in the luſt of Concupiſcence, even as the Gentiles which know not God. For God hath not called us to uncleanneſs, but unto holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now becauſe Sanctification is the crown of all other Chriſtian graces, I will here ſet down the ordinary means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Bleſſed Spirit doth infuſe the ſame in the hearts of the Elect (for all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men are incapable of it;) which is commonly done by degrees, and not ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, as their Juſtification. Yet in ſome it is more ſudden, and in others more flow, according to the activity or remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſtians in their exerciſes of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:122164:175"/>The firſt Means is, That the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit doth move them to be diligent Hearers and Readers of the Word of God;<note place="margin">Rom. 10.17.</note> For <hi>Faith</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God;</hi> And none can be Sanctifyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Juſtifying Faith. 2. It endows them with the ſpirit of Prayer, and with mortifying Graces, whereby they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Original and Actual corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 3. It moves them to be cautious in all their ways, and to be ſenſible of the ſmalleſt ſins, and to flee from all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance or provocation to ſin. 4. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth in their hearts a ſtrong Averſion to ſin. 5. It engendreth in them a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent love, and a filial fear, which keeps them from ſin. 6. It doth convince them of all their ſins; and ſpecially of their boſome ſin. 7. By this conviction it begets in them an implacable hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Darling ſin. 8. By this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred it doth enlighten their Judgement, and openeth the eyes of the ſame, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the miſerable condition they are in by the enormity and multiplicity of their ſins is made apparent unto them. 9. By the conſideration of this miſery it induceth them to ſeek earneſtly the means whereby
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:122164:175"/>they may be delivered out of it. 10. It infuſeth in them a conſtant reſolution to return to their heavenly Father, and to humble themſelves in Sackcloth and Aſhes before him. 11. It mollifies their hearts, and makes them grieve, mourn, and lament for their ſins; by which Spiritual Sorrow, never to be repented of, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets in them an unfained Repentance. 12. And Laſtly, being by this Cordial Repentance reconciled to God, by the merits of the Paſſion of their Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, it begets in them an extream thirſt after the living waters of that <hi>Fountain which was opened to the houſe of David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 13.1.</note> 
                  <hi>and to the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem for ſin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs.</hi> And ſo by a conſtant perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the ways of Righteouſneſs, they attain by degrees to that meaſure of Sanctification as is required to ſee the Lord with Joy and Conſolation. For the moſt Sanctified man upon Earth cannot attain to a perfect degree of Sanctification as long as he liveth in theſe tabernacles of clay; the perfection of this Grace being reſerved for the glorified Saints in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, to Conclude, I admoniſh all thoſe who earneſtly deſire to attain to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:122164:176"/>ſome degree of holineſs, to ſuppreſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the venom of this vitious Paſſion of Volupty, before it turn into an Habit in them; For (as I have ſaid in my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Objection of ſome Moraliſts) the Volupty of the mind doth as much encreaſe with Age, as do the vices of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice and Drunkenneſs, as it is confirmed by this Saying of the wiſe Son of <hi>Sirach, All bread is ſweet to a Whoremonger;</hi>

               <p>By theſe and many other places con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Word of God, it is apparent that the laſcivious Paſſion of Volupty is more deſtructive to men then any other Paſſion whatſoever.

                  <hi>DIogenes</hi> the Cynick, being demanded why Gold was of ſo pale a yellow; Anſwered ingenuouſly, that it was out of fear, becauſe all men did run after it to make it their captive, or rather their god; For it is daily ſeen that avaritious men are the ſlaves of their riches, and that Gold is their only Deity. But the Poet <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> being moved by a friend of his to reſolve him which of theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> of Wiſdom or Gold, was to be moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and purſued: Anſwered, Wiſdom, ſaith he; for ſhe is the Miſtreſs, and Gold is her Hand-maide; Notwithſtanding, ſaid he, I ſee daily the wiſeſt men court, wait, and attend upon the Gold-mongers and rich men of theſe days; ſo little is Vertue regarded, and Vice ſo highly eſteemed: Whereas in the judgement of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> riches are nothing but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and vexation of Spirit.

               <p>Secondly, This deſire is never free from fear and ſelf-love; ſo that Avarice is a compoſed paſſion of fear, love, and deſire.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Being thus mixt,<note place="margin">Of what paſſions A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice is compoſed.</note> it is of a violent nature by the means of love, that is extraordinarily violent in all its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: It is alſo of an inſatiable and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did nature, by the means of the paſſion of deſire, that hath an inſatiable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie; and is moſt baſe, becauſe this deſire hath no other object then
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:122164:180"/>the excrements of the Earth;<note place="margin">Avarice is of a violent, inſatiable and femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine nature.</note> for Gold is nothing but a yellow, and Silver nothing but a white clay, calcinated and refined by the beams of the Sun by a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time: It is likewiſe of a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous quality, by the means of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of fear that is of a feminine nature; ſo by the mixture of theſe ill-qualified in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, Avarice is one of the moſt baſe paſſions incident to men.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Theſe kinde of men are moſt commonly addicted to it. 1. Low and baſe minded men. 2. Old men are more addicted to it then the young. 3. Thoſe who have in their youth been riotous and prodigal, are much inclined to it when they become ancient. 4. Such as have been in great want in their youth, become avaritious, when they are old, out of fear to fall into the like ſtraits. For the firſt, all generous ſpirits diſdain to be avariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for their thoughts ſoar higher then the excrements of the Earth; whereas the low-minded are like the Swine who never riſe nor lift up their eyes to Heaven, but are ſtill fixed and routing with their ſnout in the muck-hils of the Earth.<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Dion</hi> in their Lives.</note> I mean by uſing all vile and baſe means to enrich themſelves, as <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>

Secondly, the antient are more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Avarice then young men; and this proceeds of fear, and from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience they have of the mutability of all worldly things; beſides, they conſider their weakneſs &amp; diſabilities of body to labor as they did in their youth, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hoard up what they can againſt the day of need, hope being then utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſht in their breaſt, by the cold blaſt of timerous fears which doth poſſeſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit aged men: yet this conſideration, that they have one of their feet upon the brink of their Grave, ſhould induce them to make uſe of the bleſſings of God, ſith they have but ſhort time to live, and leſs need of them then younger men. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch as have laviſhed their means by profuſe prodigalities, fall (when they are recalled from theſe courſes) from one extream to another, and from great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals become great Uſurers &amp; avaritious Miſers. Fourthly, Princes who in their youth, were of a generous ſpirit, yet having been brought by mutation of ſtate into great wants and neceſſities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come when they are antient, out of fear to fall again into the ſame ſtraits, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly avaritious, and prone to hoard up

               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, The cauſes moving men to affect Avarice, may be theſe: 1. A baſe diſtruct of the providence of God, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in their hearts by Satan through want of Faith to believe theſe precepts of our bleſſed Saviour,<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 6 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Take no thought for your life what ye ſhall eat, or what ye ſhall drink; nor yet for your body what ye ſhall put on: Is not the life more then meat, and the body more then rayment? Behold the fowls of the air; for they ſow not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not better then they? Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? And why take you thought for raiment? conſider the Lilies of the Field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they Spin. And yet I ſay unto you, that even</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of theſe. Wherefore if God ſo clothe the graſs of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is caſt into the oven, ſhall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little Faith?</hi> 2. This diffidence
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:122164:181"/>doth beget in them a faint-hearted fear to fall into poverty, if they ſcrape and heap not by hook and crook ſome heaps of Gold or Silver; for although poverty of it ſelf be innocent, yet in theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved days it is held criminal, and the greateſt vice, and miſery upon earth:<note place="margin">Prov. 14.20.</note> For the poor, ſaith <hi>Solomon, is hated even of his neighbour.</hi> Notwithſtanding ſaith he in another place,<note place="margin">Prov. 19 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Better is the poor that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his integrity, then the rich that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in his ways.</hi> 3. Becauſe none are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded in this age but the rich; yet rich men without wiſdom and piety, ſhould be no more regarded then fools; for as ſnow in Summer,<note place="margin">Alluſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Prov. 26.1.</note> and as rain in Harveſt comes unſeaſonably, even ſo honour is as unſeemly to rich men that want under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. It was an ingenuous compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a modern Author, who ſaid that a wiſe vertuous and religious poor man was like a good horſe with a leather Saddle on his back; and a vitious profane and fooliſh rich man, like a Jade that had an embroydred Saddle on his back; Men reſpecting in theſe days, more the rich and gay apparel of men then their worth and vertue. 4. Becauſe they may enjoy by riches all carnal volupties, from which the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:122164:182"/>poorer ſort are debarred by their pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 5. Becauſe they erroneouſly conceive that riches make them have many friends; but they are commonly Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants and Table-friends; for all ſuch whoſe friendſhip is grounded upon riches, and not upon the vertue and merites of the party, are time-ſervers, and of a baſe and mercenary ſpirit, and as fickle in their love and friendſhip as the wind, and at the leaſt blaſt of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace or adverſity forſake them. Theſe two inſtances ſhall prove the point: <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> the great Favourite of King <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuerus,</hi> had many friends who bowed their knees daily before him when he had the favour of the King: but as ſoon as his wrath was kindled againſt him, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the King he had erected a Gibet of fifty Cubits high to hang up <hi>Mordecai</hi> the preſerver of the Kings life;<note place="margin">Eſth. 7.9, 10.</note> and were the firſt upon the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand who caſt a Cloke upon his face, &amp; offered to hang up <hi>Haman</hi> upon the ſame Gibet.<note place="margin">See <hi>Sejanus</hi> Life.</note> 2. <hi>Sejanus</hi> the beloved Favourite of the Emperour <hi>Tiberius,</hi> had many friends as long as he was graced by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; for he was more courted by the Senators and men of War then <hi>Tiberius</hi>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:122164:182"/>himſelf: but they all forſook him when he fell into diſgrace, and were more eager and active then any, to draw his body through the kennels of the Streets of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whereby it appears that the rich mens friends are like a broken bow or a bruiſed reed. 6. Becauſe they falſly believe that riches will reſcue them out of many dangers; but they are deceived; for the ſmaller ſhrubs in a Forreſt are ſafer from being rooted up with the boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous winds, then the high Cedars in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon.</hi> And the Antient and Modern Hiſtories do verifie, that rich men under Tyrants are always the mark at which promooting knaves &amp; falſe informers do aym,<note place="margin">See <hi>Tacitus</hi> in their lives.</note> as it is apparently ſeen in the lives of <hi>Caligula, Nero, Vitellius, Domitianus</hi> and <hi>Commodus,</hi> and ſuch other Monſters in nature. Likewiſe in all civil broils and publike commotions, the richer men go ever to the pot, as it is apparent in <hi>Livies</hi> Decades,<note place="margin">See <hi>Livie</hi> in his firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade.</note> the <hi>Plebeian</hi> ever repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and envying the richeſt <hi>Patricians.</hi> So that riches do rather expoſe men to dangers then reſcue them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The evil proprieties of this ſordid paſſion are many, but I will ſpeak only of ſome of them. 1. It inticeth men
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:122164:183"/>to Idolatry; for Avaricious men make their addreſſes morning and evening to their god Mammon, in lieu to make their prayers to God. I mean in bending as ſoon as they riſe, all their thoughts and cogitations upon the means how they may encreaſe their wealth: whereby it appears that the love of money doth extinguiſh in them the love of God, and that it is almoſt as impoſſible for a rich avaritious man to obtain the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,<note place="margin">Alluſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Math 19.24.</note> as it is for a Camel to go thorow the eye of a needle; and that is the reaſon why <hi>few noble and rich are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;</hi> and why rich men are compared in the Goſpel of S. <hi>Luke</hi> to the thorny ground:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.26. Luk. 8.14.</note> becauſe the care they take to encreaſe their riches, ſmothers in them the ſeed of the Word, and hinders them to grow in ſpiritual graces: there being as great an antipathy between the carking care of this life and godlineſs, as there is between light and darkneſs;<note place="margin">Math. 6.21.</note> for where mens <hi>treaſure</hi> is, there is their heart. And that is the reaſon why Saint <hi>James</hi> doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this heavie ſentence againſt the rich who are poſſeſſed with Avarice,<note place="margin">Jam 5.1, 2, 3, 4 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Go to now ye rich men, weep and howl for your miſeries that ſhall come upon you. Your riches
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:122164:183"/>are corrupt, and your garments are moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten. Your gold and ſilver is cankered, and the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſs againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire; ye heave heaped treaſures together for the laſt dayes. Behold the hire of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers which have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth; and the cryes of them which have reaped, are entred into the eares of the Lord of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth. Ye have lived in pleaſure on the earth and been wanton; ye have nouriſhed your hearts as in a day of ſlaughter. Ye have condemned and killed the juſt, and he hath not reſiſted you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond propriety of it, is, That it deprives thoſe who are poſſeſſed with it, of all true joy, becauſe their joy and content doth only conſiſt in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their riches, which can afford no ſolid joy, the creatures having nothing in them but emptineſs: whereas the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of true joy is God himſelf, that ever will be an infinite, unchangeable and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal God. Beſides, how can avaritious men have any joy or content, that are hourly perplexed with fears of being deprived of all they have, by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand accidents which riches are ſubject
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:122164:184"/>unto?<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</note> And this moved <hi>Crates</hi> to caſt all his wealth into the Sea, ſaying he would rather drown his riches then they ſhould drown the tranquillity of his mind in fears and continual anxieties. <hi>He that loveth ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>ſhall not be ſatisfyed with ſilver:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.10.</note> And except mens deſires be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, they can have no joy nor content.</p>
               <p>The Third Propriety of it, is, That it deprives men of underſtanding. For Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritious men cannot make uſe of their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but will pinch their bellyes, goe ragged, and deprive themſelves from the comfort of all good things: Nay their harmleſs Cattle ſhall feel the ſmart of their biting Avarice. An Italian Biſhop was ſo baſe, as he did ſteal in the night time the Provender that was allowed to his Coach-horſes: But his Coach-man gave hiw a hundred baſtinadoes as a juſt reward for his Avarice. For ſeeing his horſes dayly decline and become poor and faint, he watched all night and found his Maſter ſtealing of their Provender out of their manger, and taking no notice who he was, did ſwadle him ſoundly, verifying this Saying of <hi>Solomon,</hi> That he who loveth riches, ſhall be without the fruit thereof. And this he calleth <hi>An evill
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:122164:184"/>ſickneſs,</hi> or <hi>ſore diſeaſe.</hi> And in truth, it is a ſign of Phrenſy, or of a Privation of underſtanding, when men make no uſe of the Bleſſings of God; And may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a dog that ſits upon a truſs of hay, that will not ſuffer it to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, although he cannot eat of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Propriety of it, is, That it baniſheth all Chriſtian Charity out of the hearts of men: For none are ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſted towards the Poor as Rich Avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men. And when with much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity Collectors draw from them ſome ſmal Contribution towards their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif, they repine for it, and think they draw like horſleeches their hearts blood. Nay, they will bury their Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the ground, rather then they will lend their poor Neighbor ſome part of it <hi>gratis.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</note> And this moved <hi>Aeſop</hi> to ſay to an Avaritious man, who lamented for the loſs of a Treaſure he had hid in the ground, <hi>Lament and vex not thy ſelf</hi> (ſayd he) <hi>but carry a ſtone of the like weight, and bury it in the ſame place where thy gold was, and imagine it is the ſame Gold which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from thee: For this ſtone will be as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to thee as thy Gold was, ſith thou couldſt
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:122164:185"/>not make a better uſe of it.</hi> And certainly ſuch <hi>Nabals</hi> as hoard up their Wealth, and deny to relieve the diſtreſſed <hi>Davids</hi> of theſe Times in their extream need, may be compared to that <hi>Sicilian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who being poſſeſſed with a ſtrong Phrenſy, did believe that all the rich ſhips that came into the Haven of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> were his own. Even ſo theſe miſerable Cormorants, are not Really, but Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily rich, ſith God deprives them of the uſe of their Riches.</p>
               <p>The Fifth Propriety of it, is, That it begets Pride, and makes men inſolent, diſdainfull and arrogant. For it is a Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as True as Common, That <hi>Honors and Riches corrupt good manners.</hi> And dayly Experience doth ſhow, that ſuch as become rich ſuddenly, which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of a mean and low degree, are prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and more inſolent in their carriage and comportments, then the greateſt Noble-men in the Land: And more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful towards their neighbors, then thoſe whoſe ſhoos they were formerly unworthy to untye.<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Life.</note> 
                  <hi>Craſſus</hi> from a mean condition being by his Avarice and his vile and baſe courſes to get mony, grown to be the richeſt Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> became ſo
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:122164:185"/>proud and inſolent, as to diſpute and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for the preheminency with <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixth propriety of it, is, That this ſordid paſſion doth encreaſe by age, and is moſt eager and inſatiable when men have one of their feet upon the brim of their grave, then when they are in their virility and the ſtrength of their youth: Whereas divers other paſſions, as wrath, ambition, audacity, and volupty, do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh by age; which pernitious quality ſhould move men to abhor the ſame, ſith no paſſion is more oppoſite to the tranquillity of the minde then it, becauſe when antient men ſhould only have their minde fixed upon the means appointed by God, <hi>to make their calling and election ſure,</hi> and to attain to that aſſurance of eternal bliſs, without which they can have no true peace, joy nor content, then is it moſt of all vexed and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the carking cares to encreaſe and preſerve this Idol of theirs; I mean their gold and ſilver.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The Effects of Avarice are rather more then the Proprieties of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They who are addicted to the ſame, are never loyal to their Prince nor native Countrey. And this moved <hi>Philip</hi>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:122164:186"/>King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> to ſay, that no Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was impregnable,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Paulus Emylius</hi> Life.</note> if a Mule laden with gold could enter thorow the gate of it. And the Duke of <hi>Memorancy</hi> high Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> told his King, <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt,<note place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> that the Governour of <hi>Metz</hi> was the Phenix of that Age for loyalty, ſith he had been tempted with a great ſum of gold by <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> to deliver that ſtrong hold into his hands. But the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Calice</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourths dayes was not ſo faithful; for being poſſeſſed with Avarice, he yielded up that Garriſon that is one of the Keyes of <hi>France,</hi> into the Archduke <hi>Alberts</hi> hands, for the ſum of thirty thouſand Crowns; for which diſloyalty, he and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity were degraded of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Effect of Avarice, is, That it perverteth Juſtice and Judgement; <hi>Cambiſes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> cauſed one of his Judges to be flead alive,<note place="margin">See <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in his Life.</note> and his skin to be nailed upon the Judgement Seat, becauſe he had been ſeduced by a Bribe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Innocent. And the annihilation of the power of the <hi>Roman Decemviri,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Livie</hi> in his 1. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade.</note> hapned becauſe they took Bribes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:122164:186"/>Juſtice. And the two Sons of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, Joel</hi> and <hi>Abiah</hi> who were Judges of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.2.3.</note> out of Avarice <hi>walked not in the ways of their Father, but turned aſide after luere, took bribes and perverted judgement.</hi> And this moved <hi>Jethro</hi> to give this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Son-in-law, to provide out of all <hi>the people able men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 18.22.</note> 
                  <hi>fearing God and hating Avarice, to make them Judges over Iſrael;</hi> for whereſoever Judges and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates are poſſeſſed with Avarice, the Laws are trampled under foot, and Juſtice is utterly perverted.</p>
               <p>The third Effect of it, is, That Avarice doth foment diviſions and contentions in all places whereſoever it raigneth. 1. It was the Avarice of the <hi>Roman Patricians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Livie</hi> in his 1. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade.</note> that was the only cauſe of all the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and commotions which hapned and continued for ſo many years together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelves and the <hi>Plebeians</hi> or common people of <hi>Rome:</hi> for Avarice is the mother of Uſury, Oppreſſion, and Extortion.</p>
               <p>The fourth Effect of it, is, That it maketh Princes and private men as cruel as Lyons and Tygers. 1.<note place="margin">See the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Weſt <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </note> The Avarice of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> King of <hi>Aragon</hi> moved him to undertake the diſcovery of the Weſt
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:122164:187"/>
                  <hi>Indies,</hi> and with a barbarous cruelty, to cauſe two or three millious of the poor <hi>Indians</hi> to be ſlain with the ſword, and to be torn in pieces with Maſtiffs, that his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Subjects might have a freer poſſeſſion of the gold and ſilver Mines that are there. 2. It moved <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Spain</hi> to exile out of his Dominions all the Chriſtian <hi>Moors</hi> that were in <hi>Spain;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Spain</hi> in his Life.</note> the number of men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children, who were thus cruelly baniſhed, amounting to above three hundred thouſand, and all to add to his own demains their Lands and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, under a falſe colour of zeal to Religion. 3. It moveth Marriners and Merchants to venture their lives into the furtheſt and the moſt cold and hoteſt Climates of the World to encreaſe their Wealth, many of them loſing their lives in the proſecution of it. 4. It moveth the moſt profane and debaucht ſort of men to become Rovers and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers upon the Roades and High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, to break open Houſes, and to carry away mens goods by force and violence.</p>
               <p>The fifth Effect of it, is, That Avarice hath ever been the Incendiary of Civil
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:122164:187"/>Wars. 1.<note place="margin">See <hi>Caeſars</hi> Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries and <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Life.</note> The Avarice of the <hi>Plebeian</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in the days of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> was the cauſe of the Civil Wars which hapned between himſelf and <hi>Pompeys;</hi> for by the extraordinary bribes he gave to ſome of them, they bought the voyces of the Centuries of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to make him continue in his Office of Lieutenant-General of the <hi>Roman</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions that were in <hi>France,</hi> longer then it was appointed by the Law, by which means he attained to ſuch power and reputation, that with the ſame Army which had been given him by the Senate and People to defend and enlarge the demains of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth, he changed the Government of it, and overthrew their Liberties. 2.<note place="margin">See <hi>Guicciar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> in his Hiſtory.</note> The Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of the chiefeſt Magiſtrates and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Commonwealth of <hi>Florence</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Peter de Medecis,</hi> was the cauſe of all the Civil broyls which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that State. 3. The extream Avarice, mixt with cruelty, of the Duke <hi>D'Alva</hi> Deputy Governour for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in the Low-Countreys, was the cauſe of the death of many Nobles, and of the miſerable end of thirty thouſand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants he cauſed to be drowned, hanged
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:122164:188"/>and ſlain,<note place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.</note> to confiſcate their goods; and of the rent of ſeven of thoſe Provinces from the obedience of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> 4. The Avarice of the ſixteen Zealots who had the Government of the City of <hi>Paris</hi> in the time of the Catholike League as they called it, was the cauſe of all the Civil Commotions, Murthers, and Rapines which were committed in <hi>Paris,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> and in divers other Parts of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixth Effect of Avarice, is, That it endangereth men ſouls; for men who are poſſeſſed with this paſſion, care not what indirect courſes they take to enrich themſelves; For <hi>he who maketh haſte to be rich,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 28.20.</note> ſaith <hi>Solomon, cannot be innocent;</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that his many ſins and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions make him run hazzard to be caſt into the Pit of eternal deſtruction, which is confirmed by this ſaying of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>They that will be rich, fall into temptations and ſnares, and into many fooliſh and noiſom luſts, which drown men in perdition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while ſome luſted after, they erred from the Faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="367" facs="tcp:122164:188"/>
               <p>Eighthly, The conſiderations inducing men to allay the fire of this paſſion, are theſe:
<list>
                     <item>1. They are to conſider that nature is contented with a little; for ſome bread and water, ſome Riſe, Reaſons, Almonds, or Figgs, will ſatisfie the ſame: So that all ſuch as are not nice but ſober in their diet, and temperate in their drinking, will never be enforced to ſell their Land to feed their bodies; for it is the exceſs of the ſuperfluous volupties uſed in theſe dayes that brings men to penury.</item>
                     <item>2. They are to conſider, That he who cannot be contented with a little, will not be ſatisfied with all he could deſire; nothing under the Sun being able to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the deſires of men, but God only. And that is the reaſon why S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.6.</note> 
                        <hi>That godlineſs with contentment is great gain;</hi> for none can be truly contented, except he hath the power of godlineſs in him, becauſe the love of God doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs all other deſires in men.

They are to conſider, that riches are accounted the gifts of Fortune, which is held to be blind; therefore it is no wonder if ſhe beſtows her gifts upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving men, ſuch as were <hi>Nabal, Sobna,</hi> and the rich glutton. Beſides vertuous and Religious men make conſcience of their ways, and will rather be poor then uſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct and unlawful means to enrich themſelves; but ſuch as neither fear God nor man, ſtretch their conſciences upon the Tenters, and conceive no courſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful or ſinful, ſo they enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by them.</item>
                     <item>4. They are to conſider, that Avarice is worſe then Prodigality; for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs of Prodigal men is not deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to any but to themſelves; but the courſes uſed by Avaritious men to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelves, are deſtructive to the whole Commonwealth: for all Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers, and Artificers are the better by Prodigals, but they are the worſe by Avaritious men, and ſpecially the poorer
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:122164:189"/>ſort; For they commonly engroſs or monopolize into their hands all manner of Commodities, to ſell them dear; and principally corn; and ſo like horſleeches, ſuck the very blood of the Poor: which makes them to be hated of God and of Men. The conſideration of which, ſhould move all conſcientious men to abhorr Avarice, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devor by all means to ſubdue this ſinful Paſſion.</item>

They are to conſider, that if they had in their poſſeſſion all the gold and ſilver Mines of the Weſt Indies, yet they would not adde any thing to their preſent and future Felicity, but rather tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe the firſt, and deprive them of the ſecond. Neither can they prolong their Lives an hour, nor free their bodyes from any of the numerous Infirmities they are naturally ſubject unto. It is then an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Madneſs, for men to tire their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, and to waſte their ſpirits, by labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and carking day and night, to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate ſome ſmal heaps of white and yellow Clay, that will be of no uſe unto them at the hour of death. Nay, they run great hazzard (without the mercy of God) to loſe their own ſouls in, or by the

For ſpiritual riches are free from all Accidents, durable, and eternal; but the temporal riches are ſubject to changes and mutations, and of no continuance, their abode being uncertain: men being rich to day, and extreme poor to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as it appears by the Hiſtory of <hi>Job,</hi> and of <hi>Croeſus</hi> king of <hi>Lydia:</hi> the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the richeſt man of the Eaſt; and the other the richeſt Prince in <hi>Aſia:</hi> And yet in the revolution of one day,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Of the vanity of the paſsion of Ambition.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS it is not the quality, but the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of wine that is offenſive to men: So it is the exceſs and the irregularity of mens ambition that is deſtructive to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; for as a little wine rejoyceth the heart, ſo a ſpark of ambition in the heart of men bends their minds upon generous actions: And could they make vertue and holineſs the only objects of their Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they do the honour and glory of this world, Ambition would prove to be the beſt and the moſt commendable paſſion of men.<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Life.</note> 
                  <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> did uſe to ſay, That the great Trophies of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiades</hi> did hinder him to take his reſt; even ſo, if the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of <hi>Lot,</hi> the patience of <hi>Job,</hi> the continency of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the meekneſs of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the zeal of <hi>Phineas,</hi> the fervency of <hi>David,</hi> and the holineſs of our bleſſed Saviour, were the objects of mens ambition, ambitious men would carry away the garland, and be reputed as the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:122164:191"/>only <hi>excellent</hi> upon earth.<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.3.</note> But to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively ambitious after the fading and momentary riches, honours, and glory of this world, or after the conqueſt of a Mole-hill, (for the greateſt Kingdom in Chriſtendom in compariſon of the whole Globe of the World, will appear but like a Mole-hill,) it is a meer vanity,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 6.2.</note> and an evil diſeaſe. <hi>Socrates</hi> being informed that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was proud and ambitions, and boaſted of the great demains he poſſeſſed in <hi>Attica</hi> a Province of <hi>Greece,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</note> of which <hi>Athens</hi> was the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan City, brought him into a place where there was a Map of the whole Earth, and prayed him to ſhew him where ſtood his Poſſeſſions; <hi>Alcibiades</hi> after an exact view of the ſame, found out at laſt the Province of <hi>Attica,</hi> which was no bigger then a great pins-head, but could not ſee any ſign of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, whereupon <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid unto him, Why are you then ſo proud and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for a thing of ſo little Continent, that it cannot be ſeen in this Card. Even ſo Princes and Commonwealths, who out of ambition contend for enlargement of their demains, will finde at the end, when they have ſhed their ſubjects blood, and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:122164:192"/>exhauſted their Treaſures, that they have only obtained with much ado, a ſmall Mole-hill of ground: And will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to ſay,<note place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> as <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the Second, Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> did (who through their Ambition had been the cauſe of the death of a million of men, and of the exhauſting of all the Treaſures that came out of the Weſt-<hi>Indies,</hi> which did amount in threeſcore years to above two hundred millions of Crowns, by the Wars they made about the Conqueſt of <hi>France,) viz.</hi> That with all this blood and incredible Treaſures, they had not won a Foot of ground in <hi>France,</hi> and were further from the Conqueſt of it, then they were the firſt day of their War. And verily if the ſeventeen Provinces of the Low-Countries were repreſented in a Map, and compared to the whole Globe of the Firmament, of the Seas, and the Earth, they would not ſeem to be ſo big as a Mole-hill: And yet they have this threeſcore years and ten been the object of the Ambition of him that ſtiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the greateſt King in Chriſtendom. And notwithſtanding his might and power,<note place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Netherlands.</note> and the innumerable lives of men that have been loſt, and the incredible
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:122164:192"/>Treaſures that have been exhauſted in the Conqueſt and preſervation of them, yet hath he been enforced to acknowledge ſeven of theſe Provinces to be free-States, and at this very hour courts them by his Embaſſadors, to obtain an offenſive and defenſive League with them: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Ambition of Princes and Commonwealths have no bounds, yet are they bounded by the Lord of Hoſts, and ſhall extend no further then he hath De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed: The beginning, the encreaſe, the decay, and utter annihilation of Empires, Monarchies, and Commonwealths being wholly at his diſpoſing. Notwithſtanding the deſires of Ambitious men are never ſatisfied, and are alwayes projecting to enlarge their bounds, although they are ignorant of Gods will and pleaſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; theſe ambitious deſires of theirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oftentimes the fore-runners of their ruine and annihilation.<note place="margin">See <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in his Life.</note> 
                  <hi>Croeſus</hi> King of <hi>Lydia</hi> deſiring ambitiouſly to enlarge his dominions, made War againſt <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who deprived him in one day of his Kingdom, and of his incredible Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.

<list>
                     <item>1. On the definition of this paſſion.</item>
                     <item>2. On the compoſure of it.</item>
                     <item>3. On the nature of the ſame.</item>
                     <item>4. On thoſe who are moſt addicted to it.</item>
                     <item>5. On the Cauſes that move men to be Ambitious.</item>
                     <item>6. On the proprieties of the ſame.</item>
                     <item>7. On the pernitious effects of it.</item>
                     <item>8. On the means to ſubdue the ſame.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Ambition is nothing but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant and irregular deſire of worldly honour and glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is a mixt paſſion, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of theſe,<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> of Audacity, of Hope, and Deſire. 1. Audacity expels the fears that might diſſwade Ambitious men from undertaking any perilous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes. 2. Hope infuſeth in them a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence they ſhall attain to their ends.
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:122164:193"/>3. Deſire gives them wings to proſecute with indefatigable labour, the fruition of that which they aym at.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is of a fiery, reſtleſs, and inſatiable nature. 1. It is fiery, becauſe ſuch as are more ambitious then others, are of a bilious, hot, and dry conſtitution. 2. It is reſtleſs, becauſe the bilious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which is the moſt predominant in their bodies, doth uſually aſcend up to their brains, which makes them active in all their actions, and ſudden in all their undertakings.<note place="margin">The nature of Ambition.</note> And of this natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution were <hi>Caeſar, Henry</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>France,</hi> and the laſt King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who were all three extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ambitious. 3. It is inſatiable, becauſe of the great predominancy the paſſion of deſire hath over the other paſſions of which it is compoſed, nothing being more inſatiable then the deſires of men.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Thoſe who are moſt ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, are commonly of a haughty ſpirit, envious and impatient when they ſee any other excel them in valor, honor &amp; glory. It was Ambition that moved <hi>Alexander</hi> to reject the fair offer that <hi>Darius</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> made unto him of the half of his
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:122164:194"/>Kingdom, and of his eldeſt Daughter to be his wife, (if that would have ſatisfied his ambition,) ſo he might enjoy peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the other moity the reſt of his days;<note place="margin">See <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> in his Life.</note> but this anſwer of <hi>Alexander</hi> made unto <hi>Darius</hi> upon this offer did proceed from a haughty and imperious ſpirit, <hi>viz.</hi> That as there was but one Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo there could be but one Monarch upon Earth:<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Caeſars</hi> Life.</note> And this ſaying of <hi>Caeſar</hi> did proceed from a haughty and ambitious heart, <hi>viz.</hi> That he would rather be the chiefeſt Magiſtrate in a petty City of <hi>Italy,</hi> then the ſecond in the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> And this other that he ſpake to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of a ſhip in the midſt of a ſtorm; Fear not, ſaith he, For thou doſt carry in thy ſhip <hi>Caeſar</hi> and his Fortune; as if the Winde and the Sea had been bound to obey and comply with his ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: But his paſſion of Sorrow when he wept, ſeeing the Figure of <hi>Alexander</hi> cut in Marble ſtanding in the Market place of the City of <hi>Cadice</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently manifeſt that he was of a haughty and ambitious ſpirit. Out of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it may then be collected, that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is as common to haughty and proud ſpirits, as Avarice is proper and
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:122164:194"/>peculiar to vile and baſe-minded-men.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The cauſes moving men to be ambitious, may be theſe:
<list>
                     <item>1. Self-love.</item>
                     <item>2. Pride.</item>
                     <item>3. Vain-glory.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Self-love induceth to prefer their own glory to any thing under the Sun. And it is certain that all the heroical Actions of the antient Heathens did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceed from ſelf-love, then from the love they did bear to Vertue, or to their native Countrey. And in theſe days moſt of the commendable Actions of Magiſtrates, Commanders,<note place="margin">The cauſes moving men to be Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</note> and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, have a greater reference to this ſelf-love then the glory of God and the Publick good, except it be the actions of ſome ſpecial Saints, and true children of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Pride raiſeth their hearts above the Moon; for like proud and ambitious <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> they would have all men bow their knees before them, and will be accounted as the Cedars of <hi>Libanon,</hi> and not as the brambles of the Forreſt. And this Pride makes them aſpire to the greateſt Offices and Places of the Commonwealth, being
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:122164:195"/>aſſured that by theſe Places and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they will be more honoured then for their own worth. Never conſidering that the ſteepeſt Mountains, the higheſt Clifts, Towers, and Steeples are more ſubject to be beaten down by the boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous winds and thunder-claps, then the low trees growing in the Valleys. And that God doth always exalt the humble, and ſpeaketh thus to the proud, <hi>Though thou exalt thy ſelf as the Eagle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obad. 1.4.</note> 
                  <hi>and though thou ſet thy neſt among the ſtars, thence will I bring thee down, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Vain-glory gives wings to the ambitious men, and makes them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the moſt perilous enterpriſes, if they conceive they may obtain in this life the prayſe and the applauſe of men, and make their memory famous in the Generations to come. This moved the two <hi>Decii</hi> to throw themſelves in the midſt of the Enemies Army, to ſave and to give the Victory to the <hi>Roman</hi> Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:<note place="margin">See <hi>Livie</hi> in his firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade.</note> It moved <hi>Martius Curtius</hi> to caſt himſelf on Horſe-back, armed from head to foot, into a bottomleſs Pit to free the City of <hi>Rome</hi> from the contagion of a conſuming Plague: It moved <hi>Scevola</hi>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:122164:195"/>to burn his own hand before King <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenna</hi> in the flame of a lighted Torch, to obtain an advantageous Peace for his native Countrey. And the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> knowing what power vain-glory hath over ambitious men, did ordain to this purpoſe three kinde of Triumphs, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them by theſe vain ſhews and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe and acclamations the common people made at their entring,<note place="margin">See <hi>Livie</hi> in his 1.2. and 3. Decade.</note> to hazzard their lives in Martial Atchievments; the firſt of theſe Triumphs excelling in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the ſecond, and the ſecond the laſt; that their valour might be honoured ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degrees, as it did really deſerve: Whereby it appears that vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory hath from the beginning to this day been the only aym of proud and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious men.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The proprieties of ambition are numerous, but for brevity ſake, I ſhall onely ſpeak of three of them.</p>
               <p>The firſt proprietiy of it, is, That it hath neither limits nor bounds; and this I will prove by three inſtances, that are known to ſuch as are verſ'd in ancient and Modern Hiſtories. 1. The Ambition of the <hi>Democratical</hi> Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> had no bounds, although the beginning
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:122164:196"/>of it was vile and ſmall; it was vile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt erectors of it were for the greater part Out-laws, Fugitives, and Vagabonds; and it was ſmall becauſe their number did not exceed three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand before the <hi>Sabines</hi> joyned with them; the firſt object of their Ambition was the City of <hi>Alba,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Livie</hi> in his 1. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade. Lib. 1.</note> which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in one day; the ſecond was <hi>Gabes;</hi> and the Citizens of them both were joyned with the <hi>Romans,</hi> which did much encreaſe their number, and ſo by degrees ſubdued all their neighbouring Princes and Commonwealths; then <hi>Sicilia</hi> was the object of their Ambition, then <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, Spain, France, England, Greece, Macedonia,</hi> and <hi>Armenia:</hi> And when they had in their poſſeſſion the greateſt part of <hi>Europe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Caeſars</hi> Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries.</note> 
                  <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> then the ambition of <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſwallowed up them: who from a ſervant became their imperious Lord. Neither was the ambition of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors ever limited; for the greater part of them did endevor to enlarge their Monarchy, till the days of the Emperor <hi>Trajan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Apian.</hi>
                  </note> at which time it had the largeſt extent that it ever had; for preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it began to decay, and was annihilated by its own waight, as all great Politick
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:122164:196"/>Bodies are commonly. 2. The <hi>Ottoman</hi> ambition was never limited to this day. At the firſt, it was contained within the Circumference of a Countrey Village, their number not above ſix hundred; then they extended the ſame in the Leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> and then it came over <hi>Helleſpontus</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> conquered <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>

               <p>The Second Propriety of Ambition, is, That it hateth Parity, and all Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors and Equals. Numerous Inſtances might be produced for proof of it: but half a dozen ſhall ſerve: 1. <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi> brethren, having been choſen kings or Governors of the Fugitives that were the firſt Erectors of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:122164:198"/>Commonwealth, did not raign two years together,<note place="margin">

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:122164:198"/>the power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth between them, <hi>Craſſus</hi> being gone with a great Army into <hi>Aſia</hi> to ſubdue the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> with another Army into <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Pompeius</hi> with another Army left at <hi>Rome</hi> to preſerve <hi>Italy;</hi> all three of them being exceſſively ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and ſpecially the two laſt, could not be contented with their condition, but under-hand aſpired to be abſolute Monarchs, which <hi>Caeſar</hi> after the death of <hi>Craſſus</hi> eaſily obtained. 4. After the death of <hi>Caeſar, Lepidus, Marcus Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> did divide the power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire between them; but before ſeven years came about, <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> the moſt ambitious of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the abſolute Monarch of the World, by theſe means; firſt <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> joyned together to deprive <hi>Lepidus</hi> of his part; then <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> came to a ſecond diviſion; but ambition being more predominant in <hi>Auguſtus</hi> then in <hi>Antonius,</hi> who was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to volupty, he ſoon deprived him of his part, and became the only Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch upon earth. 5.<note place="margin">See <hi>Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> in his Life.</note> The Emperour <hi>Severus</hi> at his death left his two ſons, <hi>Baſsianus</hi> and <hi>Geta,</hi> equal Heirs of the

                  <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; but <hi>Baſsianus</hi> tranſported with an unnatural ambition, ſlew his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Geta</hi> before a year came about in his Mothers arms, to raign alone. 6. <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> by a mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent did divide the Kingom of <hi>Naples</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them:<note place="margin">See the <hi>French</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtory in the Life of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth.</note> But the <hi>Spaniard</hi> being more ambitious then the <hi>French,</hi> under colour of a Toll paid for Cattel, which did really appertain to the <hi>French,</hi> but fained to be the <hi>Spaniards; Ferdinando's</hi> pride and ambition diſdaining to have a Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor or Equal in that Kingdom, deprived the <hi>French</hi> of all he held in the ſame.</p>
               <p>The third Propriety of ambition, is, That it is never free from jealouſie; I mean that which is called the jealouſie of State; And for proof of it, theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing inſtances ſhall ſuffice. 1. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Tiberius</hi> out of an ill-grounded jealouſie that <hi>Germanicus</hi> his own Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, who was extreamly beloved of the Senators, Souldiers, and common People for his vertue, valour, and noble parts, ſhould aſpire to the Empire before his death;<note place="margin">See <hi>Tacitus</hi> in his Life.</note> cauſed <hi>Lucius Piſo</hi> Governour of <hi>Syria</hi> to poyſon him at a Banquet, and then forſook the ſaid <hi>Piſo,</hi> being accuſed
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:122164:199"/>and convinced of the Fact, and ſuffered him to be ſentenced and executed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had a warrant under his own hand, commanding him to rid him out of the way; the which Warrant he durſt not produce out of fear the Tyrant would deprive his children of his incredible Riches and yearly Revenews. 2. <hi>Nero</hi> out of the ſame ambitious jealouſie, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed young <hi>Germanicus</hi> the true Heir of the Empire to be poyſoned as he ſate at his own Table. 3. <hi>Domitianus</hi> out of the like jealouſie,<note place="margin">See <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Dion</hi> in theſe Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iors lives.</note> cauſed divers <hi>Roman</hi> Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to be ſlain, and was reſolved to do the like to the Captain of his Guard, and to the beſt beloved of his Concubines, if they had not prevented him by taking away his life to preſerve their own. 4. <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh King of <hi>France,</hi> out of an ill-grounded, but violent ambitious jealouſie, that his Brother <hi>Charls</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> did aſpire to the Crown,<note place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>France</hi> and of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> cauſed him to be poyſoned ſecretly by one of his own ſervants. 5. <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>England,</hi> by the falſe impreſſions that his younger Brother <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of York had malitiouſly infuſed in his heart of this ambitious jealouſie, cauſed the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> his brother to be
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:122164:200"/>arraigned and drowned in a Butt of <hi>Malmſey.</hi> 6. <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, out of this State jealouſie cauſed the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> to be beheaded, becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him to be as willing then to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne him, and to ſet his Crown upon the Earl of <hi>Richmonds</hi> Head, as he had been ready in former times to make him that was an Uſurper, King of <hi>England.</hi> 7. This ambitious jealouſie is ſo cruel, that it makes men trangreſs the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to put their own ſons to death, as <hi>Herod</hi> did <hi>Antipater</hi> his ſon;<note place="margin">See <hi>Joſephus.</hi>
                  </note> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> ſaid ingeniouſly, that it was better to be <hi>Herods</hi> Swine then his Son.<note place="margin">See the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Hiſtory.</note> 8. <hi>Philip</hi> the Second King of <hi>Spain,</hi> cauſed Prince <hi>Charls</hi> his eldeſt Son to be put to death by the Inquiſition of <hi>Spain,</hi> out of an ambitious jealouſie that he did aſpire to bereave him of his Crown.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The Effects of Ambition are worſe then the Proprieties of it; for Paracidies, Murthers, Rebellions, Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of States, Annihilations of Laws, inteſtine and forraign Wars, with all the deſolations and miſchiefs that follow them at the heels, are the fruits of mens ambition; and of theſe I will ſpeak
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:122164:200"/>in order, and by inſtances confirm the ſame.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, <hi>Andronicus</hi> the younger,<note place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> See the Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Hiſtory.</note> out of ambition to raign, did moſt cruelly put out the eyes of his Grandfather, and famiſhed him to death in Priſon. 2. <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limus</hi> out of ambition to raign, did moſt unnaturally poyſon his Father <hi>Bajazeth,</hi> and flew all his brethren. 3.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 2.10.</note>

               <p>For the Third, <hi>Abſolom</hi> out of Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to raign, rebelled againſt his Father King <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam 26.21.</note> and did endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of life from whom he had his being. 2. <hi>Zedechiah</hi> out of ambition to raign as an abſolute King, rebelled againſt his benefactor King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King. 24.20.</note> which was the cauſe of his miſerable end. 3. <hi>Otho</hi> out of ambition to raign, rebelled againſt <hi>Galba</hi> who had made him his ſecond favourite.<note place="margin">See <hi>Tacitus.</hi>
                  </note> 4. <hi>Pippin</hi> the ſhort, out of ambition to raign, rebelled againſt his Lord King <hi>Childerick,</hi> and by force and violence cauſed him to be ſhaven as a Monk,<note place="margin">See the <hi>French</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</note> and to be ſhut up into a Monaſtery.</p>
               <p>For the Fourth, The ambition of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> was the ſecondary cauſe of the deſtruction of the <hi>Aſsyrian</hi> Monarchy: And the ambition of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was the cauſe of the overthrow of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy: And the ambition of <hi>Alexander</hi> was the cauſe of the annihilation of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy: And the ambition of
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:122164:201"/>the <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders was the cauſe of the utter ſubverſion of the <hi>Greek</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy:<note place="margin">See Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rawleighs</hi> Hiſtory of the World.</note> And the ambition of <hi>Caeſar</hi> was the cauſe of the mutation of the Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical Government of <hi>Rome</hi> into a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical: And the ambition of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the <hi>Gauls, Goths, Viſgots, Vandals,</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> of the utter ruine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy; for they rent the ſame in pieces as a Kite rends a young chiken. I ſay, the ſecondary Cauſe, for the ſecret will and Decree of God is the firſt and efficient cauſe of all the mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of States or Monarchies: And that is the reaſon why Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giveth this charge,<note place="margin">Rom. 13 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers, for there is no power but of God; the powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Fifth, From the mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of one kinde of Government to another Government,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Caeſars</hi> Life, and <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> in his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> proceeds anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation of the antient Laws of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them. It hapned ſo at <hi>Rome,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the change that <hi>Caeſars</hi> ambition brought in that Commonwealth; for the ancient Laws were annihilated, and new Laws were eſtabliſhed; and likewiſe after the coming of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:122164:202"/>into <hi>England,</hi> the antient <hi>Brittain</hi> Laws were annulled,<note place="margin">See <hi>Speed</hi> in his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> and the <hi>Norman</hi> Laws confirmed: This proverb being not more common then true, <hi>viz. From new Lords, new Laws;</hi> and this might be proved by divers inſtances out of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and modern Hiſtories; but theſe two alledged will ſerve for brevity ſake.</p>
               <p>For the Sixth, Ambition breeds di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and diviſions beget inteſtine and forraign Wars, and from theſe Wars pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the mutations of States and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, and from theſe mutations the Annihilation of antient Laws. Now the inſeparable companions of forraign and inteſtine Wars, are, Atheiſm, Schiſms in the Church, and a <hi>Laodicean</hi> luke-warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Religion, and great effuſions of blood, injuſtices, oppreſſions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations; And all theſe miſchiefs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the exorbitant and irregular ambition of men; and therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the paſſion of ambition is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vanity and vexation of ſpirit, and more deſtructive to mankinde then any other paſſion.</p>
               <p>But before I ſpeak of the means which are to be uſed to reſtrain the fury of this violent paſſion, give me leave to examine
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:122164:202"/>the juſtice, or injuſtice of the Wars which have been meerly undertaken out of an ambitious deſire of vain-glory.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that if the actions of the moſt ambitious Princes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths that have from the creation to this day bin upon the Earth, were exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without prejudice or partiality, that they would be found more injurious then juſt: If men ſet aſide the ſecret will &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, who had ordained from the beginning that theſe four great Monarchies here ſpoken of, ſhould be ſo ſucceſsful in their encreaſe; they would wonder how injuſtice and oppreſſions could have ſuch proſperous events. I will only ſpeak of the Actions of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Greeks.</hi> 1. Becauſe they have been more clearly demonſtrated to us by their Authors, then the actions of the other two. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Actions of the <hi>Aſsyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians</hi> were guided by a ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, for the puniſhment of the ſins of his own People the <hi>Jews.</hi> As for the Actions of the <hi>Romans,</hi> men may clearly ſee, that from their very beginning until the days of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> they have for the greater part been unjuſt, oppreſſive and injurious, although they with much
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:122164:203"/>cunning and art did palliate them under the cloak of Juſtice, and the right of the Laws of Nations. And as for the Civil War undertaken by <hi>Caeſar</hi> againſt his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey, it was voyd of all huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Juſtice; and Ambition only gave him the audacity to reſolve to enſlave under his yoak thoſe to whom he had been a ſervant for ſeven years together; Nay, with that very Army that they had given him and entruſted into his hands, and conſtantly paid wages to for the enlarging of their limits. And as for the invaſion of <hi>Aſia</hi> by <hi>Alexander,</hi> It was in the Opinion of the beſt Polititians, a raſh and inconſiderate enterprize, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rather from Temerity, then from prudence or true valor to undertake ſuch a Conqueſt with an Army of forty thouſand Foot and ten thouſand Horſe, when <hi>Darius</hi> had to oppoſe him twenty times as many more; yet becauſe it was decreed in the ſecret Councel of God, that he ſhould be the Head of the third Mornarchy, the end of this raſh and unjuſt enterprize proved proſperous, and not for the juſtice of his cauſe; for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> had never attempted to invade any of his Dominions, or done him any injury;
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:122164:203"/>all the pretext he had, was, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings had invaded <hi>Greece;</hi> and to prevent future invaſions, it was a wiſe policy to aſſail and give him work at home: A poor excuſe or colour of juſtice for him to deprive <hi>Darius</hi> of his Life, Empire, and incredible Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; which did well deſerve this Anſwer that a Pyrate made unto him,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Life.</note> when he was brought before him to be ſentenced to death for his Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies at Sea; For <hi>Alexander</hi> having asked him why he did uſe that baſe and unlawful trade of Pyracy; <hi>Out of need</hi> (ſaid the Pyrate;) <hi>for my Father left me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this ſmall Brigantine to maintain my ſelf, my wife and children; but thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left thee a large Kingdom, and incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Treaſures, and yet thou uſeſt this trade by the great, by depriving Princes of their Kingdoms and Treaſures, whereas I uſe it only by retail, in taking ſome ſorry Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants goods; conſider then which of us two is the greateſt Pyrate, and which of us deſerves the greateſt puniſhment. Alexander</hi> was ſo aſtoniſhed at this Anſwer, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that he ſaid nothing but the very truth, that in lieu to ſentence him to death, he made him Captain of one of
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:122164:204"/>the beſt Ships he had in his Navie. Therefore forraign and inteſtine Wars are not to be undertaken but upon juſt grounds; otherwiſe the Authors of them will be anſwerable at the laſt day for the life and blood of thoſe who have been ſlain in them, and for appropriating to themſelves ſuch Provinces or Kingdoms to which they have neither right, nor any juſt tittle.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, The means which are to be uſed to allay the fury of this paſſion, and to ſubdue it utterly if it be poſſibe, are theſe: 1. Men are to endevor to attain to a true habit in the grace and vertue of humility; for he who is truly humble, can never be ambitious; becauſe Pride and Ambition are inſeparable companions. 2. This grace of humility will beget in them a filial fear; for men before they be humbled by the conſideration of their unworthineſs, can never attain to this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial fear, the fear of God being the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of true wiſdom; <hi>And to fear God, and to keep his Commandments,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.13.</note> is, ſaith <hi>Solomon, the whole duty of a man:</hi> And thoſe whoſe are endowed with this filial fear, can never be ambitious; becauſe they know it to be offenſive to God and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:122164:204"/>to men: as the criminal effects of this ſinful paſſion here before diſcribed do witneſs the ſame. 3. Men are to ſtrive to attain to an habit of true contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for ſuch as are contented, cannot be ambitious; becauſe from the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs of the minde, proceed the ambitious deſires of men. <hi>Diogenes</hi> had more content with his Tub, to ſhelter him from the injuries of the Meteors of the Ayr, and with his wooden diſh to eat and drink therein, then <hi>Alexander</hi> had with the Conqueſt of half the World, and the fruition of all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Pomps, and laſcivious Volupties of <hi>Aſia.</hi> 4. Men are to conſider,<note place="margin">Job. 1.21.</note> 
                  <hi>That naked they came into the World, and naked they ſhall go out of it.</hi> And that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of all their ambitious undertakings will be at the concluſion, if they had conquered the whole World, but ſix foot of ground to bury them in. 5. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious men are ever to have in their minde this ſaying of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>For what is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> 6. If men will needs be ambitious, let them be ambitious to excel all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in ſpiritual Graces, <hi>and to make
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:122164:205"/>their Calling and Election ſure;</hi> That they may at their departure out of this miſerable life, be made by the merits of Chriſt Co-heirs with their bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the Kingdom of Heaven, and of eternal Glory.</p>

                  <p>Of the vanity of the paſsion of Envie.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>CImon</hi> the famous general of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi> Commonwealth, hearing a friend of his highly commending his martial Atchievments, Anſwered, <hi>That he feared they were not werthy commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, becauſe they were not envied.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Cimons</hi> life.</note> Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that in thoſe days, the noble and generous actions of the moſt valorous and vertuous men were the only object of the <hi>Athenians</hi> Envie. But <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his life giveth ſufficient reaſon why <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> actions were not envied by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> as the actions of <hi>Solon, Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocles, Alcibìades,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides</hi> were in their time (for through envie of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, they baniſhed them all for ten years,) <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe of his extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry liberality ſhewed to the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for he having great and ſpacious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains about the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> relieved the poorer ſort with corn when it was dear, and every year at <hi>Lammas</hi> laid open the Gates of his Cloſing to relieve their Cattel: And this liberality of his did
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:122164:206"/>quench the fire of Envie, ſtopped the mouths of envions men, as conceiving his own prodigality would bring him lower, and make him poorer then their own envie could wiſh or deſire. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> was one of the moſt juſt and upright Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates that ever was in <hi>Athens,</hi> and for his Juſtice, Prudence, Temperance, and other rare Vertues was called <hi>Ariſtides</hi> the juſt, and by conſequence more envyed by the common people then any other. Therefore his name being written in the Liſt of ſuch as the people did deſire to baniſh that yeer, the day appointed for the collecting of the peoples Votes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Ariſtides</hi> life.</note> a Country-fellow that could neither write nor read, came amongſt the reſt to give his voyce; and becauſe the <hi>Athenians</hi> gave their Voyces by Tickets, he addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> deſiring him to write <hi>Ariſtides</hi> name in that Ticket, whereupon <hi>Ariſtides</hi> aſtoniſhed, demanded of him, Whether he knew <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> and what injury he had done unto him, that moved him to deſire he ſhould be baniſhed; I know him not, ſaid the fellow, neither hath he done me any injury; but I cannot endure to hear him called <hi>Ariſtides</hi> the Juſt; whereupon
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:122164:206"/>

By this it appears that goodneſs and vertue is the common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of envie. Give me leave therefore to enlarge my Diſcourſe upon theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, to diſcover the venome of this vitious paſſion.</p>

                  <item>1. On the definition of Envie.</item>
                  <item>2. On the nature, cauſes, and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it.</item>
                  <item>3. On the evil Effects of Envie.</item>
                  <item>4. On the means or remedies for the curbing of it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, Envie is a mixt Paſſion, compoſed of cupidity, wrath, and hatred; cupidity makes it vile and baſe; wrath, fiery and furious; and hatred makes it loathſome and odious. And by the mixture of theſe three pernitious ingredients, it becomes one of the worſt paſſions incident to men; for where it raigneth, it produceth nothing but anguiſh, grief, and ſorrow of heart, and no profit, joy, or pleaſure at all. Envie, ſaith the Biſhop of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> is
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:122164:207"/>a ſordid paſſion,<note place="margin">See p. 369. of the Book up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> begetting a repining grief and ſorrow in the hearts of men who are poſſeſſed with it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Nature, Cauſes and Proprieties of this paſſion of Envie may be theſe: Firſt,<note place="margin">The nature of Envie.</note> Envie is by accident of a cold and dry nature, having a ſhrinking quality, like unto that of Fear and Sorrow; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Wrath, of which it is compoſed, be hot and fiery, yet being turned into Hatred, it loſeth its natural heat, becomes cold by accident, as the humor of the yellow Choler, which is hot, being burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, changeth its nature, and is turned into a cold melancholy humor. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the cauſes of Envie are theſe:
<list>
                     <item>1. Pride.</item>
                     <item>2. Self-love.</item>
                     <item>3. Malice.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Pride-begetteth Envie; for all ſuch as are proud, repine and grieve to ſee others to excel them in honours,<note place="margin">The cauſes of Envie.</note> riches, pleaſures, or in moral Vertues, and ſpiritual graces.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Self-love is the cauſe of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie; for ſuch as are poſſeſſed with ſelf-love, cannot endure that others ſhould be accounted more valiant, nor more
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:122164:207"/>learned, vertuous, or righteous then they.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Malice breeds Envie; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious men cannot ſee without grief and ſorrow their Neighbours proſperity; and all theſe ſhall be proved by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, when I ſhall ſpeak of the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious effects of this paſſion of Envie.</p>
               <p>The firſt proprietie of Envie is,<note place="margin">The evil Proprieties of Envie.</note> that ſuch as are tranſported with it, never envie thoſe who are of a lower degree then themſelves; for Envie doth ever aſcend and never deſcend, becauſe Envie is not like Hatred, which continues till death, and ſometimes after death, as it hath been proved in the Chapter of Hatred: but it encreaſeth or decreaſeth according to the proſperity or adverſity of thoſe that are envied by others; for if the party en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, become poor, or fall into miſery, the envious party will change oftentimes his envie into compaſſion and pitty.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Propriety of Envy is, That men of different Callings ſeldom envie one another: But Princes envie Princes, Commanders envie Commanders, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men envie the Leaned, Merchants en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Marchants, and Artificers envie Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers of their own calling; for a Smith
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:122164:208"/>will not Envie a Carpenter, nor a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter a Smith. <hi>Marius</hi> did envy <hi>Sylla, Pompeius Caeſar; Francis</hi> the Firſt King of <hi>France</hi> did envie the Emperour <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth;<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in their lives, and the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories.</note> and all theſe were Competitors of honour and glory. And likewiſe learned men never envie Generals of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but they envie ſuch as they fear will outgo them in the Sciences they profeſs: Orators envie Orators, and Divines envie Divines; for the objects of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious paſſion are thoſe that excel others in Valour, Prudence, Honors, Riches, Pleaſures, Sciences, Arts and Piety.</p>
               <p>The third Proprietie of Envie, is, That it enticeth men to cruelty, for if Might and Power happen to be in the hands of envious men, to ſatisfie their envie, they will commit all manner of injuſtice and Tyrannicall cruelty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The effects of Envie have from the Creation to this day been deſtructive to mankinde. And the Painter that did firſt repreſent this Paſſion under the ſhape of a woman having a wrinkled face, ſquint-eyes, a crown of Snakes on her head,<note place="margin">The evil effects of Envie.</note> and a <hi>Vultur</hi> gnawing her breaſt, was well acquainted with the evil nature and pernitious effects of Envie.
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:122164:208"/>For the Feminine Sexe firſt intimates the puſillanimity of this Paſſion, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, her wrinckled face repreſents the grief and ſorrow that is incident to ſuch as are poſſeſſed with envie. Thridly, her ſquint-eye demonſtrates the indirect ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this paſſion. Fourthly, the crown of Snakes on her head, ſignifies the anxieties of their minde. Fifthly, The <hi>Vultur</hi> gnawing her breaſt, is a lively em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of the wracking tortures wherewith Envie doth continually afflict the hearts of envions men.</p>
               <p>The firſt effect of Envie proceeding from Pride, was the cruel murder of <hi>Abel;</hi> for the pride of <hi>Cains</hi> heart did beget in him this envie, becauſe his Sacrifice was rejected of the Lord, and <hi>Abels</hi> Sacrifice was accepted, as it appears by theſe words,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>And the Lord had reſpect unto</hi> Abel, <hi>and to his Offering: But to</hi> Cain <hi>and to his Offering he had no reſpect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond effect of Envie proceeding from Pride, was, when the hearts of the Phariſees puffed up with pride, did out of a malitious envie ſlander our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, ſaying unto him,<note place="margin">Joh. 7.46.</note> 
                  <hi>That he did caſt out Devils by the power of Belzebub the Prince of the Devils,</hi> becauſe they could not endure
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:122164:209"/>to hear their own Officers ſay, <hi>Never man ſpake like this man.</hi> The firſt effect of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie proceeding from ſelf-love was this; <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> cauſed the Poet <hi>Philoxenus</hi> to be ſold for a ſlave,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</note> becauſe he was generally reputed to be a better Poet then he. The ſecond effect proceeding from ſelf-love was this, That the Emperor <hi>Adrianus</hi> cauſed <hi>Favorinus</hi> and <hi>Meliſius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Spartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> Life.</note> two Learned men, to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, becauſe they were generally reputed to be more learned in the Liberal Sciences then he. The firſt effect of Envie proceeding from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice was this, that <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren ſold him to the <hi>Midianite</hi> Merchants to be carryed and ſold as a Slave into <hi>Egypt;</hi> for being tranſported with Envie and Malice, they ſaid amongſt themſelves, <hi>Come now therefore,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 37.20.</note> 
                  <hi>and let us ſlay him, and caſt him into ſome Pit, and we will ſay, ſome evil beaſt hath devoured him, and we ſhall ſee what will become of his dreams.</hi> But God who had in his ſecret Decree other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſpoſed of him, cauſed <hi>Judah</hi> to perſwade them he ſhould be ſold, and not ſlain. The ſecond effect of Envie proceeding from Malice was the maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Envie of <hi>Saul</hi> againſt <hi>David.</hi> And for
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:122164:209"/>no other cauſe, but foraſmuch as God was pleaſed to bleſs him in all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and undertakings: And this Malice and Envie was ſo inveterate,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 29.</note> that when all his wiles miſcarryed, he perſwaded <hi>Michal</hi> his Daughter to betray her own Husband; but ſhe abhorring ſo baſe an act, out of love ſaved his life by a wile.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Tyranny and Cruelty is an effect of Envie; for the Envie of <hi>Marius</hi> againſt <hi>Sylla</hi> was the cauſe of a bloody Civil War: And the envie of <hi>Pompeius</hi> againſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> was the cauſe of a greater; and the Envie of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt againſt <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, was the cauſe of the death of a Million of men. The fifth effect of Envie is, That it begetteth ſhame and ignominy, becauſe envious men cannot excuſe nor palliate this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Envie, as men can divers other paſſions. The ambitious man will excuſe his ambition, and will ſay it is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his generoſity of ſpirit, to aſpire to honours and places of Authority; that there is none but baſe-minded men who do affect to live obſcurely. The covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man will varniſh over his avarice, and cloke the ſame by this paſſage of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.8.</note> 
                  <hi>But if any provide not for his own Family,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:122164:210"/>he hath denyed the Faith, and is worſe then an Infidel.</hi> The cholerick man will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe his wrath, and perſwade men it proceeds from a maſculine courage, and that there is none but cowards that will ſuffer injuries and affronts. The volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man will diſguiſe his Vices, and ſay this, that joy, mirth and pleaſure are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to men, and will pervert this paſſage of <hi>Solomons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.22.</note> 
                  <hi>I preceive there is nothing better that a man ſhould rejoyce in his own works.</hi> The timerous man will excuſe his puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity, and ſay, that Fear is the mother of ſecurity, and that there is more prudence to be fearful then over-bold. The curious man will varniſh over his nice curioſity, and ſay it is comely and gentile to be apparrelled <hi>a la mode,</hi> and that none but Clowns will go after the old faſhion. In a word, men have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes to turn all their vitious paſſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Vertues, Envie only excepted: for they diſclaim it and will not own it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſhameful and ignominious. The laſt evil effect of Envie is, That it fils the minds and hearts of men with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, grief and ſorrow; for repining and diſcontent do follow envious men, as the Spaniel followeth his Maſter, and the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:122164:210"/>ſhadow the body.<note place="margin">See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</note> The Philoſopher <hi>Anarcharis</hi> being demanded by a friend of his, why ſo many men were diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; becauſe they conceive ſaith he, that their Neighbours condition is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then theirs; intimating that Envie is the greateſt diſturber of peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of the minde, and that they that are addicted to this vile and baſe paſſion, can never be merry nor joyful. And <hi>Solomon</hi> the Prince of wiſdom, that was better able then any to judge of the evil nature and pernitious effects of mens paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſaith, that Envie is worſe then Wrath, as it appears by theſe words, <hi>Wrath is cruel, and anger is outragious,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 27.4.</note> 
                  <hi>but who is able to ſtand before Envie?</hi> To conclude, Envie is not only vanity, but a great torment and vexation of Spirit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The chief means or remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this paſſion of Envie, are, prayer,<note place="margin">The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies againſt Envie.</note> contentedneſs, charity, and ſelf-denial: Firſt, fervent Prayer to God is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial remedy againſt this paſſion; for Envie is one of the temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, which cannot be overcome without God be pleaſed to give men power to

                  <hi>Whereby they may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the Wicked.</hi> Secondly, contentedneſs is an approved remedy againſt Envie; for if men were contented with the condition that God hath been pleaſed to ſet them in, they would never Envie the proſperity of their Neighbous; for this diſcontent that is ſo familiar to men, proceeds from their cupidity or covetouſneſs, which is one of the ingredients of the compoſure of this paſſion of Envie, and this cupidity is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable, except men can obtain from God by fervent prayers this excellent grace of contentedneſs; for as S <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Godlineſs with contentment is great gain.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim 6.6.</note> And were a man the abſolute Monarch of the whole World, yet without this grace of contentedneſs, his deſires would never be ſatisfied, but would envie and long for ſome other imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry felicity or greater glory. And that is the reaſon why S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth exhort the Hebrews to be contented with ſuch things as they had, and that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ſhould be without covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>Let your converſation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.50.</note> ſaith he,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:122164:212"/>
                  <hi>be without covetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as ye have; for he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> Thirdly, Charity is a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign remedy againſt Envie; for if men were in charity with all men, they would never envie at the proſperity of their Neighbours; and the only antidote againſt Wrath, which is another of the ingredients of the compoſure of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Envie, is Charity; becauſe men that be endowed with the Grace of Charity, bear patiently all manner of injuries, For <hi>Charity,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.4.</note> 
                  <hi>ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth long, and is kinde.</hi> Fourthly, ſelf-denial is an excellent remedy againſt Envie; for men that deny themſelves drive all manner of hatred and Envie from their hearts. And hatred is the third ingredient of the compoſure of this paſſion of Envie; and our bleſſed Saviour doth tell us, that if we will imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and <hi>come after him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark 8.34.</note> 
                  <hi>we muſt deny our ſelves and take up his croſs and follow him.</hi> To conclude, If men would be fervent in prayers to obtain theſe foreſaid Graces, they would abhor and deteſt Envie more then they do the Peſtilence
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:122164:213"/>and the contagious diſeaſe of the Plague; for a grain of Envie is able to ſtain and blemiſh all the ſpiritual Graces of a Chriſtian.</p>
